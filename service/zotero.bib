  abstract = {According to standard assumptions in semantics, (a) ordinary users of a language have implicit beliefs about the truth-conditions of sentences in that language, and (b) they often agree on those beliefs. For example, it is assumed that if Anna and John are both competent users of English and the former utters 'grass is green' in conversation with the latter, they will both believe that that sentence is true if and only if grass is green. These assumptions play an important role in an intuitively compelling picture of communication, according to which successful communication through literal assertoric utterances is normally effected thanks to our shared beliefs about the truth-conditions of the sentences uttered in the course of the conversation. Against these standard assumptions, this paper argues that the participants in a conversation rarely have the same beliefs about the truth-conditions of the sentences involved in a linguistic interaction. More precisely, it argues for Variance, the thesis that nearly every utterance is such that there is no proposition which more than one language user believes to be that utterance's truth-conditional content. If Variance is true, we must reject the standard picture of communication. Towards the end of the paper I identify three ways in which ordinary conversations can be communication-like despite the truth of Variance and argue that the most natural amendments to the standard picture fail to explain them.}

Each individual receives a signal about the underlying state of the world, observes the past actions of a stochastically generated neighbourhood of individuals, and chooses one of two possible actions. The stochastic process generating the neighbourhoods defines the network topology. We characterize pure strategy equilibria for arbitrary stochastic and deterministic social networks and characterize the conditions under which there will be asymptotic learning—convergence (in probability) to the right action as the social network becomes large. We show that when private beliefs are unbounded (meaning that the implied likelihood ratios are unbounded), there will be asymptotic learning as long as there is some minimal amount of “expansion in observations”. We also characterize conditions under which there will be asymptotic learning when private beliefs are bounded.},

Two studies were conducted to test the prediction that direct gaze would facilitate the processing of facially communicated approach-oriented emotions (e.g., anger and joy), whereas averted gaze would facilitate the processing of facially communicated avoidance-oriented emotions (e.g., fear and sadness). The results of both studies confirmed the central hypothesis and suggest that gaze direction and facial expression are combined in the processing of emotionally relevant facial information.},

  abstract = {An unresolved controversy regarding social behaviors is exemplified when natural selection might lead to behaviors that maximize fitness at the social-group level but are costly at the individual level. Except for the special case of groups of clones, we do not have a general understanding of how and when group-optimal behaviors evolve, especially when the behaviors in question are flexible. To address this question, we develop a general model that integrates behavioral plasticity in social interactions with the action of natural selection in structured populations. We find that group-optimal behaviors can evolve, even without clonal groups, if individuals exhibit appropriate behavioral responses to each other’s actions. The evolution of such behavioral responses, in turn, is predicated on the nature of the proximate behavioral mechanisms. We model a particular class of proximate mechanisms, prosocial preferences, and find that such preferences evolve to sustain maximum group benefit under certain levels of relatedness and certain ecological conditions. Thus, our model demonstrates the fundamental interplay between behavioral responses and relatedness in determining the course of social evolution. We also highlight the crucial role of proximate mechanisms such as prosocial preferences in the evolution of behavioral responses and in facilitating evolutionary transitions in individuality.},

  abstract = {The biomolecules inside or near cells form a complex interacting system. Cellular phenotypes and behaviors arise from the totality of interactions among the components of this system. A fruitful way of modeling interacting biomolecular systems is by network-based dynamic models that characterize each component by a state variable, and describe the change in the state variables due to the interactions in the system. Dynamic models can capture the stable state patterns of this interacting system and can connect them to different cell fates or behaviors. A Boolean or logic model characterizes each biomolecule by a binary state variable that relates the abundance of that molecule to a threshold abundance necessary for downstream processes. The regulation of this state variable is described in a parameter free manner, making Boolean modeling a practical choice for systems whose kinetic parameters have not been determined. Boolean models integrate the body of knowledge regarding the components and interactions of biomolecular systems, and capture the system's dynamic repertoire, for example the existence of multiple cell fates. These models were used for a variety of systems and led to important insights and predictions. Boolean models serve as an efficient exploratory model, a guide for follow-up experiments, and as a foundation for more quantitative models.

This view regarding the development of society has, to a large extent, fallen out of favour, and especially so in those areas where the rational actor model looms large. I argue that this is unfortunate, as models of imitative learning, in some cases, agree better with what people actually do than more sophisticated models of learning. In this paper, I contrast the behaviour of imitative learning with two more sophisticated learning rules (one based on Bayesian updating, the other based on the Nash-Brown-von Neumann dynamics) in the context of social deliberation problems. I show for two social deliberation problems, the Centipede game and a simple Lewis sender-receiver game, that imitative learning provides better agreement with what people actually do, thus partially vindicating Tarde.},

  abstract = {We study techniques to incentivize self-interested agents to form socially desirable solutions in scenarios where they benefit from mutual coordination. Towards this end, we consider coordination games where agents have different intrinsic preferences but they stand to gain if others choose the same strategy as them. For non-trivial versions of our game, stable solutions like Nash Equilibrium may not exist, or may be socially inefficient even when they do exist. This motivates us to focus on designing efficient algorithms to compute (almost) stable solutions like Approximate Equilibrium that can be realized if agents are provided some additional incentives. Our results apply in many settings like adoption of new products, project selection, and group formation, where a central authority can direct agents towards a strategy but agents may defect if they have better alternatives. We show that for any given instance, we can either compute a high quality approximate equilibrium or a near-optimal solution that can be stabilized by providing small payments to some players. We then generalize our model to encompass situations where player relationships may exhibit complementarities and present an algorithm to compute an Approximate Equilibrium whose stability factor is linear in the degree of complementarity. Our results imply that a little influence is necessary in order to ensure that selfish players coordinate and form socially efficient solutions.},

Homo erectus                 was considered to be a bona fide member of the genus                 Homo                 , but opinions diverged on the generic status of earlier, more fragmentary fossils traditionally attributed to                 Homo habilis                 and                 Homo rudolfensis                 . Arguments about generic status of these taxa rested on inferred similarities and differences in adaptive plateau. However, there was near-universal agreement that the open-country suite of features inferred for                 Homo erectus                 had evolved together and provided the adaptations for dispersal beyond Africa. These features foreshadowed those of more recent                 Homo sapiens                 and included large, linear bodies, elongated legs, large brain sizes, reduced sexual dimorphism, increased carnivory, and unique life history traits (e.g., extended ontogeny and longevity) as well as toolmaking and increased social cooperation.                                                        Advances                                Over the past decade, new fossil discoveries and new lines of interpretation have substantially altered this interpretation. New environmental data sets suggest that                 Homo                 evolved against a background of long periods of habitat unpredictability that were superimposed on the underlying aridity trend. New fossils support the presence of multiple groups of early                 Homo                 that overlap in body, brain, and tooth size and challenge the traditional interpretation of                 H. habilis                 and                 H. rudolfensis                 as representing small and large morphs, respectively. Because of a fragmentary and distorted type specimen for                 H. habilis                 two informal morphs are proposed, the 1813 group and the 1470 group, that are distinguished on the basis of facial anatomy but do not contain the same constituent fossils as the more formally designated species of early                 Homo                 . Furthermore, traits once thought to define early                 Homo                 , particularly                 H. erectus                 , did not arise as a single package. Some features once considered characteristic of                 Homo                 are found in                 Australopithecus                 (e.g., long hind limbs), whereas others do not occur until much later in time (e.g., narrow pelves and extended ontogeny). When integrated with our understanding of the biology of living humans and other mammals, the fossil and archaeological record of early                 Homo                 suggests that key factors to the success and expansion of the genus rested on dietary flexibility in unpredictable environments, which, along with cooperative breeding and flexibility in development, allowed range expansion and reduced mortality risks.                                                        Outlook                                Although more fossils and archaeological finds will continue to enhance our understanding of the evolution of early                 Homo                 , the comparative biology of mammals (including humans) will continue to provide valuable frameworks for the interpretation of existing material. This comparative context enables us to formulate and test robust models of the relationships between energetics, life history, brain and body size, diet, mortality, and resource variability and thereby yield a deeper understanding of human evolution.                                       ,              Pleistocene people and environments                            In the past few decades, hundreds of hominin fossils have been recovered from well-dated sites in East Africa. In addition, early representatives from far outside Africa have been found in Asia and Europe. Recently, discoveries at Malapa in South Africa and at Dmanisi in western Asia have brought important new fossils and archaeological residues to light. Analyses of local stratigraphy, windblown dust, sea and lake cores, and stable isotopic analyses have improved the reconstruction of ancient environments inhabited by early humans. Antón               et al.               review recent evidence and arguments about the evolution of early               Homo               , arguing that habitat instability and fragmentation imposed an important selective force.                                         Science               , this issue p.               10.1126/science.1236828                        ,                             Integration of evidence over the past decade has revised understandings about the major adaptations underlying the origin and early evolution of the genus               Homo               . Many features associated with               Homo sapiens               , including our large linear bodies, elongated hind limbs, large energy-expensive brains, reduced sexual dimorphism, increased carnivory, and unique life history traits, were once thought to have evolved near the origin of the genus in response to heightened aridity and open habitats in Africa. However, recent analyses of fossil, archaeological, and environmental data indicate that such traits did not arise as a single package. Instead, some arose substantially earlier and some later than previously thought. From \textasciitilde 2.5 to 1.5 million years ago, three lineages of early               Homo               evolved in a context of habitat instability and fragmentation on seasonal, intergenerational, and evolutionary time scales. These contexts gave a selective advantage to traits, such as dietary flexibility and larger body size, that facilitated survival in shifting environments.},

In a correlated equilibrium, players rationally condition their strategies on realizations of a common external randomization device and, as a consequence, can achieve payoffs that Pareto dominate any of the game's Nash equilibria. In this paper we explore whether such correlated equilibria can be learned over time using an evolutionary learning model where agents do not start with any knowledge of the distribution of random draws made by the external randomization device. Furthermore, we validate our learning algorithm findings by comparing the end behavior of simulations of our algorithm with both the correlated equilibrium of the game and the behavior of human subjects that play that same game. Our results suggest that the evolutionary learning model is capable of learning the correlated equilibria of these games in a manner that approximates well the learning behavior of human subjects and that our findings are robust to changes in the specification and parameterization of the model.},

Using the alarm call system of vervet monkeys as a case study, I argue that interpersonal communication (or what I call “minded communication”) can and does take place in the absence of the production and recognition of communicative intentions. More generally, I argue that evolutionary theory provides good reasons for maintaining that minded communication is both temporally and explanatorily prior to the use of communicative intentions. After developing these negative points about the place of communicative intentions in detail, I provide a novel alternative account according to which minded communication is characterized in terms of patterns of action and response that function to coordinate the representational mental states of agents. I show that an account which centers on patterns of representational coordination of this sort is well suited to capture the theoretical roles associated with minded communication and that it does so in a way that provides a good fit with comparative facts about the presence of minded communication among non-human animals.},

Individual thoughts and actions, of course, must influence culture in turn, for how else can we account for changes in culture over time, or the creation of culture in the first place? In large-scale modern societies, however, tracing the impact of individuals on culture is like tracing the impact of a small stream on the ocean, unless we focus on people who wield a degree of power that makes them quite atypical.},

The negative argument is against the use of the term ‘social affordance’, a term that confuses the perspective of the researcher with that of the animal. Instead, it is advocated that we adopt, as a working hypothesis, the claim that all affordances are social; that is, all affordances are public and are, in principle, observable by a third party. The programmatic outline then shows that affordances alone are insufficient for describing social meaning. An ecological social ontology requires new tools for describing interaction processes, symbolic meaning, and material culture as structures occurring within the populated environment. © 2021 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Recent discussions of animal communication and the evolution of language have advocated adopting a ‘pragmatics-first’ approach, according to which “a more productive framework” for primate communication research should be “pragmatics, the field of linguistics that examines the role of context in shaping the meaning of linguistic utterances” (Wheeler and Fischer, Evol Anthropol 21:195–205, 2012: 203). After distinguishing two different conceptions of pragmatics that advocates of the pragmatics-first approach have implicitly relied on (one Carnapian, the other Gricean), I argue that neither conception adequately serves the purposes of pragmatics-first approaches to the origins of human linguistic communication. My main aim in this paper is to motivate–and begin to articulate–an intermediary conception whose scope is narrower than Carnapian pragmatics but broader than Gricean pragmatics. To do so, I first spell out what I take to be the key insight offered by proponents of the Gricean approach concerning the emergence of linguistic communication, namely, its being communication ‘from a psychological point of view’ (Tomasello, Origins of human communication, MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 2008). I then develop this insight using key elements from the anti-Gricean ‘biosemantic’ account of linguistic communication due to Ruth Millikan (Millikan, Language, thought, and other biological categories: New foundations for realism, MIT Press, Cambridge MA, 1984, Millikan, Tomberlin (ed), Philosophical Perspectives 9, Ridgeview Publishing, Atascedero CA, 1995, Millikan R (2006) Varieties of Meaning. Mass.: The MIT Press (paperback edition), Cambridge, Millikan, Beyond concepts: unicepts, language, and natural information, Oxford University Press, Oxford UK, 2017, and elsewhere). I argue that the intermediary pragmatics-first approach that I propose, which draws on both Gricean and Millikanian resources, would be better equipped to serve the purposes of those who search for potential precursors of human linguistic communication in animal communication.},

  abstract = {The generalized theory of evolution suggests that evolutionary algorithms apply to biological and cultural processes like language alike. Variation, selection and reproduction constitute abstract and formal traits of complex, open and often self-regulating systems. Accepting this basic assumption provides us with a powerful background methodology for this investigation: explaining the emergence and proliferation of semantic patterns, that become conventional. A teleosemantic theory of public (conventional) meaning (Millikan 1984; 2005) grounded in a generalized theory of evolution explains the proliferation of public language forms in terms of their adaptive proper function. It has also been suggested, that the emergence of meaning, can be formalized with game-theoretical tools (Skyrms 2010) within signaling systems of coordination. I want to show how closely related these approaches are, both in terms of explanandum and of outcomes. To put it in a nutshell: If the emergence of public meaning can be satisfyingly explained in terms of signaling games, then the cultural evolutionary dynamics will serve as an adequate model to describe their proliferation. Public or conventional meaning (in contrast to personal meaning) can be fully understood in terms of its evolutionary function in a population of communicators. Furthermore, I want to argue how this understanding of conventional meaning could lead us to a strong semantic holism.},

There are as many kinds of meaning as there are signaling systems, which emerge and proliferate in different contexts or environmental niches.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 25)
\par
«Although both – Skyrms and Millikan – attempt selection analyses of meaning, their starting points differ considerably, as do their methods. Nevertheless, juxtaposing them can provide valuable insights. While Millikan’s approach stands more in the tradition of a very carefully worked out and elaborate conceptual analysis, Skyrms’ explanations of meaning is a formal investigation using game theory, computer simulations and even provides the opportunity of empirical research.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 25)
\par
«According to [29, p. 56]: “A convention is merely a pattern of behavior that is (1 ) handed down from one person, pair, or group of persons to others – the pattern is reproduced – and (2 ) is such that, if the pattern has a function, then it is not the only pattern that might have served that function about as well. Thus if a different precedent had been set instead, a different pattern of behavior would probably have been handed down instead.” Conventions are historical entities, which involve some amount of arbitrariness. This definition matches almost perfectly into a framework of evolutionary SG» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 27)

«For now, it is important to note, that there is a crucial distinction between speakers meaning and PM, or (as you might also put it conceptually) between a mental and a behavioral part of a representational system. The speakers meaning is something internal, PM something external, which – in a more sociological context – has also been called “public representation” [39, p. 61].» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 27) For note "Speaker and public meaning are largely distinct":

«As Schurz [37, p. 157] puts it, any causal effect E of a subsystem of an (biological or cultural) evolutionary system S constitutes an evolutionary function F, iff 1. E is a reproduced, hereditary trait that has been positively selected, 2. namely because E contributed to the fitness of S in its phylogenetic history.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 28) For a note "Biological function"

«The kind of function that is described here is etiological and has been named “proper function” by Millikan [27, p. 17].

«“Speakers within a language community are, simply, adapted to an environment in which hearers are responding, sufficiently often, to the forms speakers produce in ways that reinforce these speaker productions. Correlatively, hearers in the community are, simply, adapted to conditions under which speakers, sufficiently often, produce these language forms in circumstances such that making conventional responses to them aids those hearers.”» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 29) Millikan [-@millikan2005, 57] explains language conventions by co-adaptation of speaker and hearers to conditions under which successful communication occurs. As she puts it:
\par
«The evolutionary function of PM lies in the mutual co-adaptation of speakers and hearers of a language community in a specific cultural context. What selection directly acts on is the way that producers create icons and the way consumers interpret them.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 29) For note "Speaker and public meaning are largely distinct":

This co-adaptation can be represented with a Lewis signaling game.
\par
«Bruner et. al. [4] created an interesting empirical application of the Lewisian framework of SG by testing participants, who faced a semantic coordination problem under specific conditions in the lab. They played iterated SG – and proved several predictions, which were based on computer simulations about the behavior of the trajectories in the population dynamics in biased and unbiased SG to be true. Signaling systems and thereby conventional meaning emerged between the participants of the experiment, at least in the simple Lewis’ standard framework.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 30)
\par
«SG is based on a coordination problem between world states and acts and allows for a probabilistic association between world states, signals and acts. Although communication can be very complex, we will mostly concentrate on the most simple case here, which consists of a set of two world states W = \{σ1, σ2\}, two messages M = \{m1, m2\} that S can communicate to R, and two acts A = \{α1, α2\}, by which R can respond to the received message. A pure S strategy is a function s : W −→ M from states to messages; a pure R strategy is a function r : M −→ A from messages to acts. There are 4 pure S and 4 pure R strategies and consequently 16 pure strategy profiles. Next to pure strategies, there are also mixed strategies.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 31)
\par
«According to [23], strict Nash equilibria in SG are called signaling systems. The meaning of the messages that constitute signaling systems have a very high probability to become conventional in a given population of senders and receivers.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 32)
\par
«If a signal mj is said to carry information, [38, p. 34], then the amount, i.e. the quantity of information is measured by the amount of change to the probabilities (P ) of any element of W = \{σ1, . . . , σi\}. Let P (σi) and P (mj|σ1) {$>$} 0 be the prior probabilities that σi occurs and if so, mj is sent. P (σi|mj) = P (σi) × P (mj)|σi) ∑ t P (σ) × P (mj|σ) shows the Bayesian likelihood of σi given mj [11, p. 361].» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 33) Franke and Wagner [-@franke2014] show the Bayesian likelihood of a world state \$\textbackslash sigma\_i\$ given a signal \$m\_j\$.
\par
«Let x and y be mixed strategies and let U be the payoff, respectively the reproductive success of a strategy in comparison to another strategy. U (x, y) represents the payoff for strategy x playing against strategy y. Then (x) is an ESS if and only if two conditions are fulfilled: 1. U (x, x) ≥ U (x, y) holds for all x 6= y This means that if a population of agents plays strategy x and if x is an ESS, no “invader”, playing y, can enter the population and do better with that. 2. If (x, x) = U (x, y) then U (x, y) {$>$} U (y, y) That means: should the invader y play equally successful against x like x would play against itself, then y has to be less successful against itself then against x. Both conditions make the infiltration of a sufficiently small group of competing strategies impossible. A locally stable ESS for social institutions (like a public language) is hard to change because movements away from current practice will prove disadvantageous for the agents that choose to play other strategies unless change of conditions. In the case of language, this means that if certain communicative interactions (words, sentences, speech acts and their meanings) have been selected in a certain population in the past and have proven stable, it will not be rational to change this behavior.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 34) Formal definition of ESS from [@maynardsmith1982].
\par
«Transferred into replicator dynamics, iterated signaling systems become ESS.8 Evolution leads the population to converge to one of the two signaling systems given this set of initial conditions.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 34)
\par
«If an adaptive process governs individuals, which are repeatedly confronted with a coordination problem as in SG, one or another signaling system (ESS) will establish, reproduce and become conventional9» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 35)
\par
«Although mi is initially meaningless, it becomes meaningful if agents use it in ways described by a signaling system. No assumptions about an already existing common understanding of the coordination problem and the other players are required. The dynamics are agnostic about the cognitive capacities of the agents. It can be concluded, that the sender and the receiver cooevolve and coadapt and the signal’s PM derives from the conventions that facilitate the coordination of both.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 35) Signals may initially contain no intrinsic meaning, and the dynamics does not require any sophisticated cognitive capacities of the agents.

«According to [15, p. 202], any semantic convention can be seen as a “function-stabilizing mechanism” in an evolutionary sense. This mechanism – Harms refers to it as a “rule” (ibid.: p. 203) – is a map from conditions to processes. To get a more precise notion of the concept, Harms characterizes it set-theoretically as a set of ordered pairs, restricted in a way that each environmental condition maps to one process alone, which is the general structure of a mathematical function. This stands in deep accordance with [29, p. 54], who describes conventional “semantic-mapping functions” (“functions” here in the mathematical sense) as determining truth- and other kinds of satisfaction-conditions. The rule (R) for an adaptive trait (AT) is generally given by: (1) RAT = \{〈ci, pi〉|AT sel pi in ci\} where c stands for “condition”, p for “process” and sel is a “selection operator”. The formula reads literally: “The rule for an adaptive trait is the set of all ordered pairs which condition in the first place and the process in the second, such that the adaptive trait was selected for performing this process in that condition” [15, p. 203]. The process is something that the mechanism does, the conditions may be proximal causes in which the rule maps to a causal chain or states of the world in which the process were performed in an adaptive way.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 38)
\par
«Millikan has a special name for such a kind of representation: “pushmi-pullyu” representation [29, p. 166]. She emphasizes: “purely descriptive and purely directive representations are forms requiring a more sophisticated cognitive apparatus to employ them than is necessary for these primitives.” (ibid). The more primitive a language system is, the less can is and ought clearly be distinguished.15 Harms calls the content of such animal signals “primitive content” (PC), featuring indicative and imperative functions at the same time [15, p. 189].» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 41)
\par
«Harms [15, p. 206] applies the same selective formalization as in the case of “intension” and “extension” – cf. equation (2) \& (3). The key is to introduce another layer of semantic adaptation, a regulatory mechanism. Imperative statements regulate social behavior via the enforcements of “rules” and conventions.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 41) There is an interesting similarity between a semantic regulatory mechanism like Harms' and regulatory networks in biology, that govern the dynamical repertoire of a given system [@albert2014].

An interesting analogy from biological evolution are structural and regulatory genes, i.e. regulatory mechanisms for a preexisting system.
\par
«The rule for any adaptive trait [cf. equation (1)] fails, when a process (message) is not accompanied by the condition (world state), which it was selected for. The “failure” of the rule can be depicted as:» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 41)
\par
«(4) F ailure of RAT = (σi ∧ ¬mi) where〈σi, mi〉 ∈ RAT For a kind of SM, the correspondence rule for its corrective signal CS = \{cs1, . . . , csi\} is given by: (5) RSM = \{〈σi ∧ ¬mi where 〈σi, mi〉 ∈ RAT,cs〉|SM sel cs when (σi ∧ ¬mi)\} That reads: “The rule for a stabilizing mechanism is the set of all ordered pairs with the failure of the rule for an adaptive trait in the first place and a corresponding corrective signal in the second place, such that the stabilizing mechanism was selected for sending the corrective signal if a message is not sent when the relevant world state occurs.” If the adaptive trait (i.e. the signal-act pair) fails to execute its proper function (Millikan), SM itself is selected for detecting this failure of an adapted behavior and motivating a corrective signal/action to restore it.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 42) According to @harms2004, convention in an evolutionary sense is a function-stabilizing mechanism. It consists of two parts: a (proper) function and a rule for self-correction if this function fails to execute. Formally, these parts are given by equations (1) and (5).
\par
«Already quite early in her work, Millikan [27, p. 23] speaks of “firstorder and higher order reproductive established families”. Conventions are are first-order families, whereas corrective signals could be seen as higher-order families. Often, they are not direct copies of one another but still serve the same proper function, namely to restore a first-order proper function.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 42) Are descriptive and directive signals on the same ontological level? [@bateson1955] claims that their relations are paradoxical, for signals can switch frames, sets of possible signals.

maybe similar to @hindriks2021?
\par
«The synthetic conclusion of this paper can be summarized as follows: A set of statistical processes, e.g. the combined strategy s1 (m1 if σ2, m2 if σ2) / r1 (a1 if m1; a2 if m2) is a semantic convention and therefore carries PM (given as a holistic distributed structure), iff the advantageous trait (payoff ) came from coordinated and iterated reproduction in a signaling game.» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 45)
\par
«“[. . . ] we do not have to endow the sender and receiver with a pre-existing mental language in order to define a signaling system.”» (Baraghith, 2019, p. 46) As Skyrms argues, agents do not need to have pre-existing mental language for a signaling system to be established [skyrms2010, 7].},

The GRN approach has advanced the fields of genomics and development, and we identify organizational similarities between networks of genes that build the brain and networks of neurons that encode brain function. In this perspective, we engage the analogy between developmental networks and neural networks, exploring the advantages of using GRN logic to study behavior. Applying the GRN approach to the brain and behavior provides a quantitative and manipulative framework for discovery. We illustrate features of this framework using the example of social behavior and the neural circuitry of aggression.},

  abstract = {Cultural evolutionary theory has been alternatively compared to a theory of forces, such as Newtonian mechanics, or the kinetic theory of gases. In this article, I clarify the scope and significance of these metatheoretical characterisations. First, I discuss the kinetic analogy, which has been recently put forward by Tim Lewens. According to it, cultural evolutionary theory is grounded on a bottom-up methodology, which highlights the additive effects of social learning biases on the emergence of large-scale cultural phenomena. Lewens supports this claim by arguing that it is a consequence of cultural evolutionists' widespread commitment to population thinking. While I concur with Lewens that cultural evolutionists often actually conceive cultural change in aggregative terms, I think that the kinetic framework does not properly account for the explanatory import of population-level descriptions in cultural evolutionary theory. Starting from a criticism of Lewens' interpretation of population thinking, I argue that the explanatory role of such descriptions is best understood within a dynamical framework—that is, a framework according to which cultural evolutionary theory is a theory of forces. After having spelled out the main features of this alternative interpretation, I elucidate in which respects it helps to outline a more accurate characterisation of the overarching structure of cultural evolutionary theory.},

Noticeable by its absence in the literature is any attempt to provide an argument for the law of desire – I propose such an argument here. It is noted that Sripada's "divided mind" theory of willpower provides a counterexample to the version of the law of desire my argument defends, but I note that a reformulated version of the law of desire survives this critique.

Dynamical independence instantiates the intuition of an emergent macroscopic process as one possessing the characteristics of a dynamical system "in its own right", with its own dynamical laws distinct from those of the underlying microscopic dynamics. We quantify (departure from) dynamical independence by a transformation-invariant Shannon information-based measure of dynamical dependence. We emphasise the data-driven discovery of dynamically-independent macroscopic variables, and introduce the idea of a multiscale "emergence portrait" for complex systems. We show how dynamical dependence may be computed explicitly for linear systems via state-space modelling, in both time and frequency domains, facilitating discovery of emergent phenomena at all spatiotemporal scales. We discuss application of the state-space operationalisation to inference of the emergence portrait for neural systems from neurophysiological time-series data. We also examine dynamical independence for discrete- and continuous-time deterministic dynamics, with potential application to Hamiltonian mechanics and classical complex systems such as flocking and cellular automata.},

  abstract = {Two themes about the conceptual system are developed: (1) modal simulations underlie conceptual processing; (2) conceptual representations are situated. The construct of situated conceptualization-a multimodal simulation that supports one specific course of situated action with a particular category instance-integrates these themes. A given concept produces many different situated conceptualizations, each tailored to different instances in different settings. A situated conceptualization creates the experience of “being there” with a category instance in a setting via integrated simulations of objects, settings, actions, and introspections. On recognizing a familiar type of instance, an entrenched situated conceptualization associated with it becomes active, which provides relevant inferences via pattern completion. Supporting empirical evidence from cognitive psychology, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience is reviewed.},

Conceptual knowledge is thus grounded and situated in modality-specific systems, in that it involves simulation processes and pattern completion inferences for predictions about forthcoming events and subjective realism. It is then suggested that pattern completion inferences within situated conceptualizations potentially support diverse forms of intelligent activity when perceiving, acting, thinking, interacting with conspecifics, or sharing emotions.

In this article, we build a formal framework within which these behavioral attributes emerge from the interactions of purposive agents. We then derive mathematical results showing these behaviors are optimal given our assumptions. Our framework rests on two primary assumptions: (1) agents play ensembles of games, not just single games as is traditionally the case in evolutionary game theory models; and (2) agents have finite cognitive capacity. Our analysis combines agent-based techniques and mathematics, enabling us to explore dynamics and to prove when the behaviors produced by the agents are equilibria. Our results provide game theoretic foundations for cultural diversity and agent-based support for how cultural behavior might emerge.},

Natural Principles are taken to be innate to substances and arise from their natures, while Laws of Nature are external and imposed from without. The paper takes the view that to explain this transition, one needs to examine the history of philosophical theories of substantial action. It argues that during the late Middle Ages and in the Early Modern era, philosophers began to disentangle substantial actions from the nature of substances. This process of disentangling action eventually led to the concept of Laws of Nature, according to which laws compel a body to act in a certain way even though its nature does not.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {In many daily situations, our behavior is coordinated with that of others. This study investigated this coordination in a doubles-pong task. In this task, two participants each controlled a paddle that could move laterally near the bottom of a shared computer screen. With their paddles, the players needed to block balls that moved down under an angle. In doing so, they needed to make sure that their paddles did not collide. A successful interception led to the ball bouncing back upwards. Importantly, all communication other than through vision of the shared screen was excluded. In the experiment, the initial position of the paddle of the right player was varied across trials. This allowed testing hypotheses regarding the use of a tacitly understood boundary to divide interception space. This boundary could be halfway the screen, or in the middle between the initial positions of the two paddles. These two hypotheses did not hold. As an alternative to planned division of labor, the behavioral patterns might emerge from continuous visual couplings of paddles and ball. This was tested with an action-based decision model that considered the rates of change of each player’s angle between the interception axis and the line connecting the ball and inner edge of the paddle. The model accounted for the observed patterns of behavior to a very large extent. This led to the conclusion that decisions of who would take the ball emerged from ongoing social coordination. Implications for social coordination in general are discussed.},

Accordingly, the problem of “intentional existence” (or rather “intentional inexistence”) has resurfaced in Crane’s revival of the Brentanoian theme (Crane in The objects of thought, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2013; Aspects of psychologism, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2014). Here, I revise Crane’s construal of Brentano’s notion of intentional inexistence and reinterpret it in terms of a moderate version of relationalism. My relationalist theory of intentionality is inspired by what goes by the name of Noneliminativist Structural Realism (NSR) in the contemporary philosophy of science. NSR allows for a robust realist interpretation of the role of scientific models. The underlying insight of the paper is that it is best to be realist about the structure of the intentionality, which is the common element of the diverse theories of intentional objects. The Outcome is Structural Realist theory of Intentionality (SRI for short). I argue that SRI is not liable to the notorious objection of the impossibility of relata-less relations. I conclude that SRI fulfils the goal of robust psychological realism more economically and straightforwardly than Crane’s application of the notion of models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The focus is on the central issue of the economy of research in abduction and self-correction by error reduction in induction. We show how Peirce’s logic of science receives support from modern breakthroughs in computational neuroscience, and more specifically from Karl Friston’s statements of active inference and the Free Energy Principle, namely the account of how organisms’ capacity to decrease the discrepancy between the expected value and actual outcomes entails the minimisation of errors in their hypotheses about the world. A scientific account of organisms’ capacity to choose policies and form expectations is aligned with Peirce’s theories of abduction and induction, and especially with the economy of research. The upshot is the recovery of Peirce’s theory of the logic of science in the context of active inquiry.},

«deduction is by no means limited to the type of necessary reasoning characteristic of mathematical demonstrations. In Peirce’s theory, deduction consists of logical analysis (or the theory of real definitions) and demonstrative reasoning (R 905; Pietarinen \& Bellucci, 2014). The former involves the development of logical tools, systems and diagrammatic notations to perform tasks to analyse various phenomena, while the latter concerns actually carrying out deductive reasoning steps in two distinctive fashion, namely as corollarial (‘trivial’) or theorematic (‘creative’) inferences.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 2)
\par
«FEP lies at the nub of a viable scientific account of perception-cognition in terms of probabilistic inferences. Among others, FEP provides a general framework that unifies the Bayesian brain theory, game-theoretic account of natural selection (Maynard Smith \& Price, 1973), and neuro-computational theories of action, cognition, perception, and consciousness (Friston, 2010; Friston \& Frith, 2015; Friston \& Stephan, 2007).» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 3)
\par
«In the light of abductive guesses, FEP serves as the generalised guiding principle for active inferences, inferences that can change the organisms’ internal states according to the expectations that the organism entertains. It also explains how multi-scale directedness of living beings leads to the choosing of such strategy profiles (general habits of action) and stable policies that through organisms’ forming of new expectations allow them to optimise their cognitive grip on the world.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 3)
\par
«We conclude the paper by submitting that the same basic mechanisms that maximise the survival of fit organisms also underpin abduction and the economy of research, and (pending the incorporation of deduction into this picture in full through model-based and diagrammatic reasoning; see Pietarinen \& Beni, 2021a, b) Peirce’s inferential theory of scientific inquiry in general» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 4)
\par
«Induction is a tricky notion and it could be unpacked in a number of ways. According to Deborah Mayo’s reading, Peirce provides an ingenious conception of induction in terms of reliability, in the sense that inductive mechanisms ensure the trustworthiness of inferences on the basis of “the ability to control error probabilities of test procedures” (Mayo, 2005, p. 301). Mayo phrases Peirce’s theory of trustworthy or reliable inductions in terms of self-correction:» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 4)
\par
«Self-Correcting Thesis SCT: methods for inductive inference in science are error correcting; the justification for inductive methods of experimental testing in science is that they are self-correcting. (Mayo, 2005, p. 299)» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 5)
\par
«Error reduction (also self-correction or error-correction, as Mayo calls it) is an experimental process that finds clear statistical expression. It needs to satisfy two main conditions (Mayo, 2005, pp. 305–306). 1. Error reduction should allow for learning from the results of confrontation between the theory and evidence, so that the method could detect the discrepancy between predicted and actual outcomes. 2. The method should be able to check its own premises so that in the case of detecting error they (i.e., errors) could be subtracted from the methods of analysis of pieces of evidence.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 5)
\par
«We (as cognitive agents) generate models of (or hypotheses about) the causal structure of the world, and use these generative models to represent the causes of our sensations through statistical inferences.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 6)
\par
«FEP provides a unifying framework that subsumes various streams of research in cognitive science. It comprises Bayesian theories of cognition (Daw et~al., 2005; Dayan et~al., 1995), predictive processing theory (Rao \& Ballard, 1999) and optimal decision theory (Knill \& Pouget, 2004) (for a review of the history see Friston, 2012a). FEP unifies these theories of optimisation and supplements them with an evolutionary account of the organisms’ dynamical interactions with their environment. Organisms do not have direct access to the causal structure of the world and could represent it through topdown mechanisms of probabilistic active inferences.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 6)
\par
«Integral to FEP’s account of the agent-world dynamical relationship is the notion of “active inference”.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 6)
\par
«Free energy is an information-theoretic measure (Friston, 2010, p. 2). Assuming that s \textasciitilde{} is the set of sensory signals, p(s ̃,~θ|m) is the probabilistic (generative) model m that generates sensory consequences s \textasciitilde{} from their causes θ, and q(θ) is recognition density or the probabilistic representation of environmental causes. With these constructs in place, we can define the free energy in the following way.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 7)

\par
«Perception, therefore, results from a comparison between the top-down flow of predictions and the upward going flow of evidence. The brain (or the organism’s body plan overall) uses the discrepancy between predicted input and evidence (i.e., surprisal) to update beliefs about the causes of perceptions that are beyond the evidentiary boundary (Hohwy, 2014). This, in turn, involves abduction (Pietarinen \& Beni, 2021a, b), the initial stage in the logic of science.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 8)
\par
«The discrepancy between generative models and sensory data indicates that the generated models of causes were not precise enough. FEP also accounts for the satisfaction of the second condition, explaining how it is that some organisms could revise their premises with reference to the hierarchical mechanisms of PEM. After spotting the discrepancy between the predicted inputs and the actual ones, the system uses this discrepancy (i.e., free energy or surprisal) and updates models of causes at each level up to the prior models of the causes at the topmost level.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 8)
\par
«Action can reduce free energy by intervening in causes of sensations in the external world and thus manipulating sensory inputs (Friston, 2009, p. 295).» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 9)
\par
«FEP characterises actions as evidentiary inference, by associating them with policies. In other words, policies are ordered sequences of actions selected to minimise free energy expected after following a course of action (Hohwy, 2014, p. 271).» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 9)
\par
«Free Energy itself is a mathematical bound on surprisal on sampling some data, and surprisal is the negative log-probability of an outcome (Friston, 2010, p. 2).» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 11)
\par
«Free energy is the bound or limit on the agent’s entropy or surprisal, meaning that for the agent to survive, the divergence between its expected values and control states (as parts of generative models that refer to approximate Bayesian posteriors) shall not exceed appropriate bounds on free energy. In order to increase their chance of nourishment and prosperity and avoid dangers that lead to the extinction of their species, organisms must be able to form hypotheses that lead to reliable expectations.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 13)
\par
«Action (as an inferential process) can be modelled in terms of cost-utility decision problems in biological contexts that assign survival value to optimised beliefs about the causal structure of the world.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 15)
\par
«To maximise its survival, the organism must minimise its entropy and maximise its expected value by finding evidence for its hypotheses about the world. Not all hypotheses about the world are worth taking seriously, and expending a ‘full cost model’ of time and energy to check upon their validity status would be an existential mistake.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 15)
\par
«Successful action in the environment is defined in terms of optimal behaviour which is dependent on the Page 15 of 21 94 European Journal for Philosophy of Science (2021) 11: 9» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 15)

«13 success of the agent in dissolving uncertainty by minimising expected free energy (Friston et~al., 2015, pp. 201–204).» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 16)
\par
«Crucially, log evidence can always be decomposed into accuracy minus complexity. This means that minimising surprise is equivalent to providing an accurate account of the sensorium that minimises complexity. Interestingly, acting to minimise expected surprise can also be associated with minimising expected complexity (known as~risk~in economics and Bayesian statistics), while at the same time minimising expected inaccuracy (also known as ambiguity).» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 16)
\par
«The epistemic part means that much of our behaviour is about seeking information and reducing uncertainty; that is, reducing instances of expected surprise (Hohwy, 2014; Friston et~ al., 2013). Risk is particularly interesting, given that it refers to the expected complexity, which scores the computational complexity cost of any model or hypothesis. In this sense, an ‘economic’ sampling of the environment is exactly the minimisation of expected complexity cost.» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 16)
\par
«Thick models allow for the counterfactual formulation of expectations and take into account both the strategic decisions to act (namely situations that are actually never reached) and the defeasible nature of their actions (namely those represented by counterfactuals that have cancellable antecedents). Organisms with temporally thick models can model predictive posteriors that include beliefs about future outcomes, counterfactual outcomes, and hidden states, whereas the current posterior of the other kinds of complex systems covers only hidden states (Friston et~al., 2015, p. 192).» (Beni и Pietarinen, 2021, p. 18)},

Its main thesis was that there is good historical evidence that scientific communities have, historically, consistently failed to conceive of plausible alternatives in fundamental domains of science. Moreover, this failure to exhaust the space of epistemic possibilities could still be a deep feature of our epistemic situation, in ways that seriously challenge realist claims about science. An energetic literature has emerged that develops and challenges Stanford's articulation of the problem, his use of historical evidence, and the anti-realist conclusions which he draws. To capitalise on those debates, we organised a two-day workshop at the University of Durham to take stock of the debate. This collection is the fruit of that event.}

The authors examine how social norms are triggered by particular schemata and are grounded in scripts. Just as schemata are embedded in a network, so too are social norms, and they can be primed through spreading activation. Moreover, the expectations that allow a social norm’s existence are inherently grounded in particular scripts and schemata. Using interventions that have targeted gender norms, open defecation, female genital cutting, and other collective issues as examples, the authors argue that ignoring the cognitive underpinnings of a social norm can hamper the effectiveness of behavioral interventions.},

  abstract = {Social norms, the informal rules that govern behavior in groups andsocieties, have been extensively studied in the social sciences.Anthropologists have described how social norms function in differentcultures (Geertz 1973), sociologists have focused on their socialfunctions and how they motivate people to act (Durkheim 1895 [1982],1950 [1957]; Parsons 1937; Parsons \& Shils 1951; James Coleman1990; Hechter \& Opp 2001), and economists have explored howadherence to norms influences market behavior (Akerlof 1976; Young1998a). More recently, also legal scholars have touted social norms asefficient alternatives to legal rules, as they may internalizenegative externalities and provide signaling mechanisms at little orno cost (Ellickson 1991; Posner 2000)., With a few exceptions, the social science literature conceives ofnorms as exogenous variables. Since norms are mainly seen asconstraining behavior, some of the key differences between moral,social, and legal norms—as well as differences between norms andconventions—have been blurred. Much attention has instead beenpaid to the conditions under which norms will be obeyed. Because ofthat, the issue of sanctions has been paramount in the socialscience literature. Moreover, since social norms are seen as centralto the production of social order or social coordination, research onnorms has been focused on the functions they perform. Yeteven if a norm may fulfill important social functions (such as welfaremaximization or the elimination of externalities), it cannot beexplained solely on the basis of the functions it performs. Thesimplistic functionalist perspective has been rejected on severalaccounts; in fact, even though a given norm can be conceived as ameans to achieve some goal, this is usually not the reason why itemerged in the first place (Elster 1989a, 1989b). Moreover, although aparticular norm may persist (as opposed to emerge) because of somepositive social function it fulfills, there are many others that areinefficient and even widely unpopular., Philosophers have taken a different approach to norms. In theliterature on norms and conventions, both social constructs are seenas the endogenous product of individuals’ interactions (Lewis1969; Ullmann-Margalit 1977; Vandershraaf 1995; Bicchieri 2006). Normsare represented as equilibria of games of strategy, and as such theyare supported by a cluster of self-fulfilling expectations. Beliefs,expectations, group knowledge and common knowledge have thus becomecentral concepts in the development of a philosophical view of socialnorms. Paying attention to the role played by expectations insupporting social norms has helped differentiate between social norms,conventions, and descriptive norms: an important distinction oftenoverlooked in the social science accounts, but crucial when we need todiagnose the nature of a pattern of behavior in order to intervene onit.},

Convention, in turn, is modeled in a manner derived from that of David K. Lewis. Convention is usually held to be inadequate for models of social ontologies, with one primary reason being that there seems to be no place for normativity. I argue that two related changes are required in the basic modeling framework in order to address this (and other) issue(s): (1) a shift to an intentional model—among other reasons, in order to account for normativity—and (2) moving away from the belief-desire, propositional attitude, framework for understanding the intentional realm toward an interactive, pragmatic model of intentionality. These shifts provide natural approaches to: (1) understanding the normativities of social realities; (2) the sense in which social ontology is often constituted in implicit relations among the participants rather than elaborated and iterated explicit beliefs and desires; (3) and language.},

"There is one sense in which Lewis' conventions do at least seem to involve normativity, and that is the sense in which they are solutions to coordination problems, and coordination problems are constituted in terms of relationships among participants' preferences. Violation of a convention, therefore, would seem to violate the preferences of those involved, perhaps even the preferences of the violator. There is, therefore, at least a kind of instrumental normativity: honoring a convention is a means to the end of satisfying various participants' preferences, and is normative in that sense."

"The normativity of truth value is the most important characteristic of intentionality, of aboutness, and it emerges in anticipations of what is or might be possible." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z4AWUEPP?page=3}{Bickhard 2008:141})
\par
"I generically call standard models of representation encodingist models because they all assume that representation is constituted as some form of encoding—as some special kind of correspondence between the brain or mind and (something in) the world that somehow captures for the brain or mind what that correspondence is with. Real encodings do exist, and are in fact quite important, especially in our age. Encodings can be illustrated with Morse code, in which, for example, "..." encodes "s". Morse code is useful because dots and dashes can be sent over telegraph wires, while characters cannot. Similarly, binary codes are ubiquitous in contemporary communications and computers. But such an encoding relationship only exists insofar as one or more people know about it—unless they represent the dots and dashes and the characters and the relationships between them. All of the crucial representations have to already be in place in order for the encoding to exist. Encodings are representational stand-ins, not emergent representations themselves. They are useful as stand-ins, but not for modeling basic representation. Nevertheless, standard assumptions are that all representation is encoding, and this is what I call encodingism." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z4AWUEPP?page=4}{Bickhard 2008:142})
\par
"Recognition of the importance of this problem is strengthened by recognition of the fact that it is a variation on the radical skeptical argument: we cannot determine the truth or falsity of our own representations because to do so would require that we step outside of ourselves (take up the external perspective mentioned above) and compare our representations with what is being represented to see if they match or not. This argument has survived centuries of attempts to solve or dissolve it, so it is perhaps not surprising that standard models do not even address the problem." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Z4AWUEPP?page=5}{Bickhard 2008:143})
\par
"The central point here is that an agent participating in a convention is also a potential social agent more generally, and cannot be participating without actually being such a social agent. So, putting forward the claim (implicit or explicit) that I am a potential participant in some instance of a convention presupposes (usually implicitly) that I am a potential social agent more generally,15 including the normative issues of (at least) competence, reliability, and integrity."

The focus is on two foundational forms of normativity, that of normative function and of representation as emergent in a particular kind of function. This process model of representation, called interactivism, compels changes in many related domains. The discussion ends with brief attention to three domains in which changes are induced by the representational model: perception, learning, and language. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {The ST/ICERD blue series contains an earlier discussion paper with the same title called “Part I”. This sought to defend the Rawlsian position on social contract issues by an appeal to Rubinstein-type bargaining arguments employed “in the original position”. The current paper is not “Part II” of this earlier paper, but a re-appraisal of the whole problem. The re-appraisal continues to defend a version of the Rawlsian position against Harsanyi’s utilitarian alternative, but no longer makes the error of emphasizing technical matters from the theory of non-cooperative bargaining models. It is necessary that the right ideas be borrowed from this theory, but the crucial issue is that “commitment” be properly modeled. The bulk of the paper is concerned with justifying the manner in which the term “properly modeled” is to be interpreted. The treatment forces close attention to be given to questions of the inter-personal comparison of utilities. This treatment may be of some independent interest, since it leads to some unifying considerations for cooperative bargaining solutions. No background in game theory or knowledge of mathematics beyond elementary algebra is required to read the paper. On the other hand, the arguments do often hinge on points which need to be thought about with some precision.},

Maurice Bloch argues for a naturalist approach to social and cultural anthropology, introducing developments in cognitive sciences such as psychology and neurology and exploring the relevance of these developments for central anthropological concerns: the person or the self, cosmology, kinship, memory and globalisation. Opening with an exploration of the history of anthropology, Bloch shows why and how naturalist approaches were abandoned and argues that these once valid reasons are no longer relevant. Bloch then shows how such subjects as the self, memory and the conceptualisation of time benefit from being simultaneously approached with the tools of social and cognitive science. Anthropology and the Cognitive Challenge will stimulate fresh debate among scholars and students across a wide range of disciplines.},

  abstract = {We present agent-based simulations of a model of a deme-structured population in which group differences in social institutions are culturally transmitted and individual behaviors are genetically transmitted. We use a standard extended fitness accounting framework to identify the parameter space for which this co-evolutionary process generates high levels of group-beneficial behaviors. We show that intergroup conflicts may explain the evolutionary success of both: (a) altruistic forms of human sociality towards unrelated members of one's group; and (b) group-level institutional structures such as food sharing which have emerged and diffused repeatedly in a wide variety of ecologies during the course of human history. Group-beneficial behaviors may evolve if (a) they inflict sufficient fitness costs on outgroup individuals and (b) group-level institutions limit the individual fitness costs of these behaviors and thereby attenuate within-group selection against these behaviors. Thus, the evolutionary success of individually costly but group-beneficial behaviors in the relevant environments during the first 90,000 years of anatomically modern human existence may have been a consequence of distinctive human capacities in social institution building.},

Such multiparty settings raise a number of challenges for classical theories of communication, which largely focus on dyadic interactions. In this study, we investigated how speakers adapt their referring expressions over time as a function of the feedback they receive from multiple parties. We collected a large corpus of multiparty repeated reference games (98 games, 390 participants, 116K words) where speakers designed referring expressions for groups of 1 to 5 listeners. Larger groups tended to use more words total and to introduce more new words; nonetheless, most groups were able to converge to more efficient conventions regardless of the number of listeners.},

Here we suggest that these features are best explained as the outcome of evolved human cognition, in such domains as mating, moral judgment and social exchange. As empirical illustrations, we show how this evolved psychology makes marriage systems, legal norms and commons management systems intuitively obvious and compelling, thereby ensuring their occurrence and cultural stability. We extend this to propose under what conditions institutions can become ‘natural’, compelling and legitimate, and outline probable paths for institutional change given human cognitive dispositions. Explaining institutions in terms of these exogenous factors also suggests that a general theory of institutions as such is neither necessary nor in fact possible. What are required are domain-specific accounts of institutional design in different domains of evolved cognition.},

A central idea is that our capacity for planning agency is at the heart of this cross-temporal organization of our individual, human agency. Appeal to this role of our capacity for planning agency both fits our commonsense self-understanding and, I conjecture, would be a part of an empirically informed psychological theory that begins with-- but potentially adjusts--this commonsense self-understanding. The basic thought is that we are resource-limited agents who achieve cross-temporal organization in part by settling in advance on prior, partial plans. These somewhat stable partial plans help pose problems of means and preliminary steps, and in pursuit of needed coordination help filter potential options. They thereby provide a background framework for downstream thought and action"--},

  abstract = {It is almost universally accepted that the Frege–Geach Point is necessary for explaining the inferential relations and compositional structure of truth-functionally complex propositions. I argue that this claim rests on a disputable view of propositional structure, which models truth-functionally complex propositions on atomic propositions. I propose an alternative view of propositional structure, based on a certain notion of {$<$}em{$>$}simulation{$<$}/em{$>$}, which accounts for the relevant phenomena without accepting the Frege–Geach Point. The main contention is that truth-functionally complex propositions do not include as their parts truth-evaluable propositions, but their simulations, which are neither forceful nor truth-evaluable. The view makes room for the idea that there is no such thing as the forceless expression of propositional contents and is attractive because it provides the resources for avoiding a fundamental problem generated by the Frege–Geach Point concerning the relation between forceless and forceful expressions of propositional contents. I further argue that the acceptance of the Frege–Geach Point mars Peter Hanks' and François Recanati's recent attempts to resist the widespread idea that assertoric force is extrinsic to the expression of propositional contents. Rejecting this idea, I maintain, requires a deeper break with the tradition than Hanks and Recanati have allowed for.}

As a starting point we consider the signaling game introduced by Lewis (Convention~1969). We find that in experimental settings, small groups can quickly develop conventions of signal meaning in these games. We also investigate versions of the game where the theoretical literature indicates that meaning will be less likely to arise—when there are more than two states for actors to transfer meaning about and when some states are more likely than others. In these cases, we find that actors are less likely to arrive at strategies where signals have clear conventional meaning. We conclude with a proposal for extending the use of the methodology of experimental economics in experimental philosophy.},

  abstract = {Social interaction occurs across many time scales and varying numbers of agents; from one-on-one to large-scale coordination in organizations, crowds, cities, and colonies. These contexts, are characterized by emergent self-organization that implies higher order coordinated patterns occurring over time that are not due to the actions of any particular agents, but rather due to the collective ordering that occurs from the interactions of the agents. Extant research to understand these social coordination dynamics (SCD) has primarily examined dyadic contexts performing rhythmic tasks. To advance this area of study, we elaborate on attractor dynamics, our ability to depict them visually, and quantitatively model them. Primarily, we combine difference/differential equation modeling with mixture modeling as a way to infer the underlying topological features of the data, which can be described in terms of attractor dynamic patterns. The advantage of this approach is that we are able to quantify the self-organized dynamics that agents exhibit, link these dynamics back to activity from individual agents, and relate it to other variables central to understanding the coordinative functionality of a system's behavior. We present four examples that differ in the number of variables used to depict the attractor dynamics (1, 2, and 6) and range from simulated to non-simulated data sources. We demonstrate that this is a flexible method that advances scientific study of SCD in a variety of multi-agent systems. © 2017 Butner, Wiltshire and Munion.},

We ask how well existing evidence supports a sociocultural account explaining how children learn what is conventional, and that meanings are conventional. Specifically, we consider empirical support for two hypotheses: that parents provide systematic cues regarding conventions and conventionality to children, and that children learn from these cues. Considering research involving conventional word meanings, object uses, and social behaviors, we find impressive support for both hypotheses. Parent-child conversations may support children\&amp;\#8217;s expectation that people within a community tend to know and use the same words, and have similar knowledge and expectations. Finally we discuss ongoing controversies and future research ideas.},

  abstract = {In the literature generally, "joint attention" is used for cases in which two or more people are jointly attending perceptually to one and the same object or scene. This chapter argues that joint attention scenarios provide cases of communication that seem more basic than can be modeled in terms of Gricean intentions. Joint attention seems to play a significant role in the development of children. Children are of course usually intensely social from the moment of their birth. In the most basic case of joint attention, in which child and caregiver are focused on a single object and exchanging looks and glances about it, there is something freewheeling about the interaction. A simple way to get away from the picture of joint attention as driven by the intentions of the participants is to consider cases in which joint attention seems to be largely driven exogenously.},

The vocabulary carves a middle way between advocates and critics of evolutionary perspectives by substituting the concept of repeated assembly for nature-nurture dualism. A model of core configurations-based on human morphology and ecology in human evolutionary history-is presented, and I argue that these configurations offace-to-face groups are the selective context for uniquely human mental systems. Hence, human cognition is ?truly social,? specialized for group living. The relevance of the core configuration model is illustrated with respect to two areas of interest to social psychologists: the self and social identity, and distributed cognition and shared reality. A final section illustrates the integrative power of the core configuration model with a brief comparison of the social and cognitive tasks faced by scientists and foragers.},

  abstract = {Humans are a fundamentally social species. Our evolution is a product of the coevolution of genetic endowment, social structure, and culture. The dominant metaphor in the human sciences, "selfish gene theory" (Dawkins, 1976) or the "gene's-eye view" of evolution, has limited resources to theorize groups and the consequences of group living for the human mind. This chapter draws on multilevel selection theory, which offers a framework more appropriate than genes for psychological levels of analysis. An expanded evolutionary theory has a crucial advantage in the human sciences: It enables us to point at recurrence without getting embroiled in nature-nurture controversies. I propose a model of core configurations in face-to-face groups as the selective environment of uniquely human mental systems and the reorganization of earlier evolved "building blocks." If the model is valid, we should expect human mental systems to correlate with core configurations. We should also expect that capabilities specialized for specific configurations can be extended and recombined for novel behavior and situations, including life in the modern world. The model rejects the traditional reductionist view of biology as the basis for psychology, which in turn is the basis for culture. These three arenas are more reasonably viewed as coconstructive in human evolution. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {This paper is about two topics: metaepistemological absolutism and the epistemic principles governing perceptual warrant. Our aim is to highlight—by taking the debate between dogmatists and conservativists about perceptual warrant as a case study—a surprising and hitherto unnoticed problem with metaepistemological absolutism, at least as it has been influentially defended by Paul Boghossian (Fear of knowledge: against relativism and constructivism, Oxford University Press, Oxford, {$<$}a href="\#CR3"{$>$}2006a{$<$}/a{$>$}) as the principal metaepistemological contrast point to relativism. What we find is that the metaepistemological commitments at play on both sides of this dogmatism/conservativism debate do not line up with epistemic relativism {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}nor{$<$}/em{$>$} do they line up with absolutism, at least as Boghossian articulates this position. What this case study reveals is the need in metaepistemological option space for the recognition of a weaker and less tendentious form of absolutism, what we call "environment relativism". On this view, epistemic principles are knowable, objective, and they can serve as the basis of particular epistemic evaluations, but their validity is relative to the wider global environment in which they are applied.}

We consider a model of incomplete information in which each player receives a signal, interpreted as an allocation to a role, and can make his action choice conditional on his role. Our main result demonstrates that 'near to' any correlated equilibrium is an approximate correlated equilibrium 'with conformity' -- that is, an equilibrium where all 'similar players' play the same strategy, have the same probability of being allocated to each role, and receive approximately the same payoff; in short, similar players 'behave in an identical way' and are treated nearly equally. To measure 'similarity' amongst players we introduce the notions of approximate substitutes and a (delta,Q)-class games -- a game with Q classes of players where all players in the same class are delta-substitutes for each other.},

But what does it mean for an object to be somewhere? How are objects tied to the space they occupy? In this book Roberto Casati and Achille C. Varzi address some of the fundamental issues in the philosophy of spatial representation. Their starting point is an analysis of the interplay between mereology (the study of part/whole relations), topology (the study of spatial continuity and compactness), and the theory of spatial location proper. This leads to a unified framework for spatial representation understood quite broadly as a theory of the representation of spatial entities. The framework is then tested against some classical metaphysical questions such as: Are parts essential to their wholes? Is spatial co-location a sufficient criterion of identity? What (if anything) distinguishes material objects from events and other spatial entities? The concluding chapters deal with applications to topics as diverse as the logical analysis of movement and the semantics of maps.},

Here, we study an artificial system of social conventions in which human subjects interact to establish a new coordination equilibrium. The findings provide direct empirical demonstration of the existence of a tipping point in the dynamics of changing social conventions. When minority groups reached the critical mass-that is, the critical group size for initiating social change-they were consistently able to overturn the established behavior. The size of the required critical mass is expected to vary based on theoretically identifiable features of a social setting. Our results show that the theoretically predicted dynamics of critical mass do in fact emerge as expected within an empirical system of social coordination. © 2017 The Authors.},

By reflecting on some cases, I shall try to argue that the most puzzling issue which engineers and philosophers should be aware that they have to jointly challenge may be that what we are actually doing through algorithmic automatisation is developing a novel human condition, according to which: (1) we are progressively thinking that algorithmic abstraction is always better than mental abstraction, because, at least in the Western culture, we come from a history of a progressive restriction of the best use of our minds to the realm of rationality, first, then to the realm of computation, second, and then to the realm of algorithmic automatisation, third, which finally exceeds our minds and (2) in doing so, we are progressively externalising not only human contents, but also human abilities, i.e., we are progressively atrophying ourselves, by becoming creatures who are progressively delegating the core of their very essence, which has always included the epistemological ability, together with the ethical courage, of making complex decisions on both our lives and the others' lives.}

  abstract = {In pure-coordination games where there are multiple Nash equilibria, the selection of coordinated responses is inexplicable by rational-choice theory – yet coordination is ubiquitous in daily interactions. The psychological game theory therefore evokes the idea of focal-points: some equilibria being chosen due to its salience, as well as through predicting (i.e., mentalizing) other's response. Previous work has been limited to investigating how structural atrophy relates to deficits in coordination, or how brain activations differ between intuitive and deliberated coordination. In this study, we investigated how the strategy of coordination is reflected in the brain, compared to when no coordination is required. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), we examined the neural correlates of deriving a response to a category where participants had to either answer freely (i.e., a survey) or try to match their response with another participant (i.e., coordinate). We found that the coordination trials elicited significantly larger changes in oxyhemoglobin [HbO] concentration than survey trials in frontopolar and lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). Individual differences in behavioral focal index was significantly correlated with [HbO] concentration in lateral PFC. Granger Causality (GC) analysis revealed greater effective connectivity from frontopolar to lateral PFC, and less GC from lateral PFC to frontopolar in the coordination condition. Our findings highlight the crucial role of frontopolar and lateral PFC in human coordination.},

  abstract = {This article examines the concept of the so-called inference to the best decision in relation to neurobiology. It explains that the idea of inference to the best decision, often referred to by philosophers as abduction, is also known as in experimental psychology as case-based reasoning. The article discusses the tension that has developed between the sanctity of the “ought/is” dogma and what is known about the neurobiology of social behavior and suggests that the cognitive process that we loosely call inference to the best decision is a solution to this tension. It also expresses optimism that psychology and neuroscience will eventually uncover at least the general principles concerning how neural networks perform these functions and that the two domains of explaining and deciding will have much in common.},

This result is based on a determistic view of cultural attraction, different from the probabilistic view introduced in Sperber (1996). We defend this probabilistic view, show how to model it, and argue that, when both attraction and selection are at work, both affect final outcomes.},

To solve this problem we propose an argument in favor of ‘belief-less reasoning’, a mode of inference that leads to converge on the optimal solution ignoring the beliefs of the other players. We argue that belief-less reasoning is supported by a commonsensical Principle of Relevant Information that every theory of rational decision must satisfy. We show that this principle can be used to justify (some versions of) team reasoning, as well as other schemes of practical reasoning that do not involve sophisticated meta-representation.},

Such models describe formal inferential relations between theories at different levels. I argue against reduction and for a mechanistic model of interfield integration. According to the mechanistic model, different fields integrate their research by adding constraints on a multilevel description of a mechanism. Mechanistic integration may occur at a given level or in the effort to build a theory that oscillates among several levels. I develop this alternative model using a putative exemplar of reduction in contemporary neuroscience: the relationship between the psychological phenomena of learning and memory and the electrophysiological phenomenon known as Long-Term Potentiation. A new look at this historical episode reveals the relative virtues of the mechanistic model over reduction as an account of interfield integration.},

Ecologists study nutrient cycling mechanisms and their devastating imbalances in estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay. In fact, much of biology and its history involves biologists constructing, evaluating, and revising their understanding of mechanisms. With In Search of Mechanisms, Carl F. Craver and Lindley Darden offer both a descriptive and an instructional account of how biologists discover mechanisms. Drawing on examples from across the life sciences and through the centuries, Craver and Darden compile an impressive toolbox of strategies that biologists have used and will use again to reveal the mechanisms that produce, underlie, or maintain the phenomena characteristic of living things. They discuss the questions that figure in the search for mechanisms, characterizing the experimental, observational, and conceptual considerations used to answer them, all the while providing examples from the history of biology to highlight the kinds of evidence and reasoning strategies employed to assess mechanisms. At a deeper level, Craver and Darden pose a systematic view of what biology is, of how biology makes progress, of how biological discoveries are and might be made, and of why knowledge of biological mechanisms is important for the future of the human species.},

Philosophy of Science, 67(1), 1–25). My concern is with the minimal suggestion that an adequate philosophical theory of scientific explanation can limit its attention to the format or structure with which theories are represented. The representational subsumption view is a plausible hypothesis about the psychology of understanding. It is also a plausible claim about how scientists present their knowledge to the world. However, one cannot address the central questions for a philosophical theory of scientific explanation without turning one’s attention from the structure of representations to the basic commitments about the worldly structures that plausibly count as explanatory. A philosophical theory of scientific explanation should achieve two goals. The first is explanatory demarcation. It should show how explanation relates with other scientific achievements, such as control, description, measurement, prediction, and taxonomy. The second is explanatory normativity. It should say when putative explanations succeed and fail. One cannot achieve these goals without undertaking commitments about the kinds of ontic structures that plausibly count as explanatory. Representations convey explanatory information about a phenomenon when and only when they describe the ontic explanations for those phenomena.},

Consequently, the levels metaphor is used in different domains to relate different items by different relations. At the highest level is the behavioral or cognitive phenomenon of spatial memory, studied as the capacity of animals to solve different types of maze. Levels of control and levels of processing are species of causal levels, which are defined by a particular asymmetrical causal relation among the hierarchically ordered items. In levels of control, the relata are agencies and the relation is some sort of dominance or subordination. Higher levels of control, direct, or regulate the goings-on at lower levels. Bosses and employees, sheriffs and deputies, and queen bees and drones are at different levels of control. Levels of mechanisms should also be distinguished from levels of realization.},

However, common knowledge and convention entered mainstream game theory only when they were formulated, later and independently, by other theorists. As a result, some of the most distinctive and valuable features of Lewis' game theory have been overlooked. We re-examine this theory by reconstructing key parts in a more formal way, extending it, and showing how it differs from more recent game theory. In contrast to current theories of common knowledge, Lewis' theory is based on an explicit analysis of the modes of reasoning that are accessible to rational individuals and so can be used to analyse the genesis of common knowledge. Lewis' analysis of convention emphasises the role of inductive reasoning and of salience in the maintenance of conventions over time.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a revival of interest in the method of explication as a procedure for conceptual engineering in philosophy and in science. In the philosophical literature, there has been a lively debate about the different desiderata that a good explicatum has to satisfy. In comparison, the goal of explicating the concept of explication itself has not been central to the philosophical debate. The main aim of this work is to suggest a way of filling this gap by explicating 'explication' by means of conceptual spaces theory. Specifically, I show how different, strictly-conceptual readings of explication desiderata can be made precise as geometrical or topological constraints over the conceptual spaces related to the explicandum and the explicatum. Moreover, I show also how the richness of the geometrical representation of concepts in conceptual spaces theory allows us to achieve more fine-grained readings of explication desiderata, thereby overcoming some alleged limitations of explication as a procedure of conceptual engineering.}

Because successful coordination requires complementary choices, these opportunities raise the puzzle of how people attain the common knowledge that facilitates coordination, in which a person knows X, knows that the other knows X, knows that the other knows that he knows, ad infinitum. We show that people are highly sensitive to the distinction between common knowledge and mere private or shared knowledge, and that they deploy this distinction strategically in diverse social situations that have the structure of coordination games, including market cooperation, innuendo, bystander intervention, attributions of charitability, self-conscious emotions, and moral condemnation.},

There is a wealth of descriptive accounts of scientific English, both from a synchronic and a diachronic perspective, but only few attempts at a unified explanation of its evolution. The explanation we offer here is a communicative one: while external pressures (specialization, diversification) push for an increase in expressivity, communicative concerns pull toward convergence on particular options (conventionalization). What emerges over time is a code which is optimized for written, specialist communication, relying on specific linguistic means to modulate information content. As we show, this is achieved by the systematic interplay between lexis and grammar. The corpora we employ are the Royal Society Corpus (RSC) and for comparative purposes, the Corpus of Late Modern English (CLMET). We build various diachronic, computational n-gram language models of these corpora and then apply formal measures of information content (here: relative entropy and surprisal) to detect the linguistic features significantly contributing to diachronic change, estimate the (changing) level of information of features and capture the time course of change.},

This question is typically not asked in the cognitive sciences, so strong is the consensus that only individual agents have constitutive efficacy. In this article we challenge this methodological solipsism and argue that interindividual relations and social context do not simply arise from the behavior of individual agents, but themselves enable and shape the individual agents on which they depend. For this, we define the notion of autonomy as both a characteristic of individual agents and of social interaction processes. We then propose a number of ways in which interactional autonomy can influence individuals. Then we discuss recent work in modeling on the one hand and psychological investigations on the other that support and illustrate this claim. Finally, we discuss some implications for research on social and individual agency.},

We also discuss the role played by individual vulnerability as well as the vulnerability of social interaction processes in the co-creation of meaningful action. Finally, we outline some implications of this interdisciplinary fraternization for the empirical study of social understanding, in particular in social neuroscience and psychology, pointing out the need for studies based on dynamic systems approaches on origins and references of coordination, and experimental designs to help understand human co-presence.},

Since most social entities, from small communities to large nation-states would disappear altogether if our cognitive abilities ceased to exist, DeLanda proposes a novel approach to social ontology that asserts the autonomy of social entities from the conceptions we have of them. He argues that Gilles Deleuze's theory of assemblages provides a framework in which sociologists and geographers studying social networks and regions can properly locate their work and fully elucidate the connections between them. Indeed, assemblage theory, as DeLanda argues, can be used to model any community, from interpersonal networks and institutional organizations, to central governments, cities and nation states.},

Not only do we share and coordinate our own inner life with that of the people we interact with, but we also constantly make implicit and explicit reference to the intentional states of others who may or may not be present at the time of speaking, or who may even exist only in the imagined worlds of thought and fiction. In the cognitive sciences, this polyphony has generally been conceptualised as a series of embedded 'orders of intentionality': A thinks that B understands that C expects... (etc.). I argue that this conceptualisation stands in stark contrast to how multiple perspectives are handled in actual discourse and interaction. Based on linguistic and narratological analysis of literary texts, newspaper articles, examples from spoken discourse, and stimuli from psychological experiments investigating multiple-order intentionality in the lab, a new perspective is offered on how we deal with networks of embedded and interlinked intentional states. The findings are discussed in the light of current theories about mindreading (a.k.a. ‘theory of mind’), discussing in particular cognitive models, issues of development and learning, and scenarios of how this capacity may have evolved in our lineage.},

We review the evolution of this field within sociology via bibliometric analysis and in-depth analysis of the following subfields where this new work is appearing most rapidly: (a) social network analysis and group formation; (b) collective behavior and political sociology; (c) the sociology of knowledge; (d) cultural sociology, social psychology, and emotions; (e) the production of culture; (f) economic sociology and organizations; and (g) demography and population studies. Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well. We conclude by discussing challenging new obstacles in the field, calling for increased attention to sociological theory, and identifying new areas where computational social science might be further integrated into mainstream sociology.},

  abstract = {This is a lightly edited transcript of a plenary talk given at the Beyond Positivism conference, Montreal, August 8–10 2017. The talk followed others by Christopher Winship and Frédéric Vandenberghe, which are mentioned in the text. The paper argues that critical social science needs an ontology of values, and that a coherent ontology must recognize that values are created by human beings in social settings, rather than being objectively true. Recognizing this, however, need not expose us to the moral nihilism of extreme relativism. Drawing on the work of Habermas and the capabilities approach, I argue that we can reason about what sorts of basic values we should be committed to, without invoking the concept of objective values. This provides us with material that we can build on to construct more complex constructive critical arguments.}

Most commonly, it is seen as radically opposed to realist social theory. Dave Elder-Vass argues that social scientists should be both realists and social constructionists, and that coherent versions of these ways of thinking are entirely compatible with each other. This book seeks to transform prevailing understandings of the relationship between realism and constructionism. It offers a thorough ontological analysis of the phenomena of language, discourse, culture, and knowledge, and shows how this justifies a realist version of social constructionism. In doing so, however, it also develops an analysis of these phenomena that is significant in its own right.},

It is essentially a work of exposition that offers a tool box of mechanisms--nuts and bolts, cogs and wheels--that can be used to explain complex social phenomena. Within a brief compass, Jon Elster covers a vast range of topics. His point of departure is the conflict we all face between our desires and our opportunities. How can rational choice theory help us understand our motivation and behavior? More significantly, what happens when the theory breaks down but we still cleave to a belief in the power of the rational? Elster describes the fascinating range of forms of irrationality--wishful thinking, the phenomenon of sour grapes, discounting the future in non-cooperative behavior. He shows how these issues bear directly on our lives in such concrete situations as wage bargaining, economic cartels, political strikes, voting in elections, and court decisions involving child custody.},

I argue against prominent views that attempt to unify all social groups or to divide them into simple typologies. Instead I argue that social groups are enormously diverse, but show how we can investigate their natures nonetheless. I analyze social groups from a bottom-up perspective, constructing profiles of the metaphysical features of groups of specific kinds. We can characterize any given kind of social group with four complementary profiles: its "construction" profile, its "extra essentials" profile, its "anchor" profile, and its "accident" profile. Together these provide a framework for understanding the nature of groups, help classify and categorize groups, and shed light on group agency.}

  abstract = {The thesis of methodological individualism in social science is commonly divided into two different claims—explanatory individualism and ontological individualism. Ontological individualism is the thesis that facts about individuals exhaustively determine social facts. Initially taken to be a claim about the identity of groups with sets of individuals or their properties, ontological individualism has more recently been understood as a global supervenience claim. While explanatory individualism has remained controversial, ontological individualism thus understood is almost universally accepted. In this paper I argue that ontological individualism is false. Only if the thesis is weakened to the point that it is equivalent to physicalism can it be true, but then it fails to be a thesis about the determination of social facts by facts about individual persons. Even when individualistic facts are expanded to include people’s local environments and practices, I shall argue, those still underdetermine the social facts that obtain. If true, this has implications for explanation as well as ontology. I first consider arguments against the local supervenience of social facts on facts about individuals, correcting some flaws in existing arguments and affirming that local supervenience fails for a broad set of social properties. I subsequently apply a similar approach to defeat a particularly weak form of global supervenience, and consider potential responses. Finally, I explore why it is that people have taken ontological individualism to be true.},

It is concerned with analyzing the various entities inthe world that arise from social interaction., A prominent topic in social ontology is the analysis of social groups.Do social groups exist at all? If so, what sorts of entities are they,and how are they created? Is a social group distinct from thecollection of people who are its members, and if so, how is itdifferent? What sorts of properties do social groups have? Can theyhave beliefs or intentions? Can they perform actions? And if so, whatdoes it take for a group to believe, intend, or act?, Other entities investigated in social ontology include money,corporations, institutions, property, social classes, races, genders,artifacts, artworks, language, and law. It is difficult to delineate aprecise scope for the field (see section 2.1). In general, though, the entities explored in social ontology largelyoverlap with those that social scientists work on. A good deal of thework in social ontology takes place within the social sciences (see sections 5.1–5.8)., Social ontology also addresses more basic questions about the natureof the social world. One set of questions pertains to theconstituents, or building blocks, of social things in general. Forinstance, some theories argue that social entities are built out ofthe psychological states of individual people, while others argue thatthey are built out of actions, and yet others that they are built outof practices. Still other theories deny that a distinction can even bemade between the social and the non-social., A different set of questions pertains to how social categories areconstructed or set up. Are social categories and kinds produced by ourattitudes? By our language? Are they produced by causal patterns? Andis there just one way social categories are set up, or are there manyvarieties of social construction?, The term ‘social ontology’ has only come into widecurrency in recent years, but the nature of the social has been atopic of inquiry since ancient Greece. As a whole, the field can beunderstood as a branch of metaphysics, the general inquiry into thenature of entities.},

  abstract = {Research in evolutionary biology and philosophy of biology and cognition strongly suggests that human organisms modify their environment through active processes of niche construction. Recently, proponents of the free-energy principle and variational active inference have argued that their approach can deepen our understanding of the reciprocal causal relationship between organisms and their niche on various scales. This paper examines the feasibility and scope of variational formalisations and conceptualisations of the organism-niche nexus with a particular focus on the extended active inference account. I will draw a conceptual distinction between selective niche construction, developmental niche construction, and organism-niche coordination dynamics and argue that these notions capture different causal patterns, each of which with a distinct scope. Against this background, I will analyse and discuss the extended active inference account and its strategy to integrate variational active inference with work on extended cognition. The proponents of extended active inference assume that their account can provide an explanation of selective niche construction, developmental niche construction, and organism-niche coordination dynamics. However, my key claim will be that this account has the potential to elucidate the workings of organism-niche coordination dynamics, but does not adequately capture the causal patterns of selective niche construction and developmental niche construction.},

However, subjects might use alternative focal points to coordinate, in which case the method may deliver distorted measurements of the social norm.

Peirce, in order to re-examine both action and representation under a Peircean light. The focus lays on autopoietic enactivism because this approach offers a wider theoretical scope to cognition based on the continuity of life and mind, embodiment, dynamic and non-linear interaction between a system and its environment which are compatible ideas with Peirce's semiotic pragmatism. The term 'pragmatic' has been introduced in cognitive science to reinforce the idea that cognition is a form of practice and to help action-oriented viewpoints to escape representationalism. In this paper, I shall try to demonstrate that Peirce's semiotic pragmatism can be a meaningful methodological path to guide a reconciliation between not only anti-Cartesianism and representation but also representation and action. In order to accomplish this purpose, Peirce's account to action, habit, thought and mind will be addressed through some of the guiding principles of his semiotic—sign and sign action. What follows is the re-examining of the problem of representation—as refuted by autopoietic enactivism—under the light of Peirce's semiotic pragmatism.},

By contrast, an additive strategy for valuation allows flexible combination of reward information required in uncertain or changing environments. We hypothesized that the level of uncertainty in the reward environment should determine the strategy used for valuation and choice. To test this hypothesis, we examined choice between risky options in humans and rhesus macaques across three tasks with different levels of uncertainty. We found that whereas humans and monkeys adopted a multiplicative strategy under risk when probabilities are known, both species spontaneously adopted an additive strategy under uncertainty when probabilities must be learned. Additionally, the level of volatility influenced relative weighting of certain and uncertain reward information, and this was reflected in the encoding of reward magnitude by neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.},

  abstract = {This article is an introduction to the Synthese Special Issue, Natural Kinds: Language, Science, and Metaphysics. The issue includes new contributions to some of the main questions involved in the present philosophical debates on natural kinds and on natural kind terms. Those debates are relevant to philosophy of language, philosophy of science, and metaphysics. In philosophy of language it is highly debated what the meaning of natural kind terms is, how their reference is determined, as well as whether there are differences and similarities between the semantics of natural kind terms and that of other sorts of kind terms. In philosophy of science, natural kinds are relevant because they are the basis for scientific classifications and play an explanatory role in scientific theories; thus one aim of science is to discover natural kinds and theorize about them. Natural kinds are also relevant in metaphysics, where many questions involving natural kinds are debated and especially those concerning the sort of entities we refer to when using natural kind terms, i.e., the ontological status of natural kinds; in this regard there are different views, such as conventionalism, realism and essentialism. Another metaphysical question is what it is that characterizes the naturalness of kind divisions. The introduction sketches the antecedents of some of the present views on natural kinds and natural kind terms, and indicates some of the topics dealt with in the articles that make up the issue, which can be classified in the following groups: (1) the metaphysics and epistemology of natural kinds (2) the semantics of natural kind terms and other kind terms (3) questions on species and (4) other related issues on natural kinds. However, many of the articles cover more than just one of these topics.}

Aside from theory and simulation, associations of behaviors with familiar agents play a crucial role in social understanding. This role has been neglected so far. We illustrate the roles of fluency and associations in social understanding in false belief tasks.},

  abstract = {This dissertation reexamines the role of behavioral analysis to propose a modified research program for socio- cognitive phenomena--demonstrating its potential by presenting a two-step proof-of-concept on baboon data. I build on two Complex Systems Thinking approaches to behavior -- Hinde's model of social complexity, and Hutchins' theory of distributed cognition. By giving Hinde and Hutchins a state-space framing I can apply a well- established tool-kit of sequential analysis for social interactions. These analyses represent a shift in emphasis from asking 'what-is-it-for' to how-does-it-work'. First, I examine male-female-infant relations in the period after birth to demonstrate how to create a more systematic tracking of social complexity, emphasizing context : By building immediate context directly into the data- structures I can use the same data structure to look at study factors from long-term cumulative context of both relationships and group structure. By analyzing state- transitions over independent tallies I am able to relate interaction dynamics more directly to successive levels of social complexity. Second, I track distributed cognition by looking at consort turnover (CTO) events as socio- cognitive systems that resolve 'who will be the next consort male?' Instead of performance measures based on outcome, the system-level regularities allow me to track individual profiles of participation. Behavioral traces of Extended-Embodied Distributed Cognition 'leak' outward from the skull to the physical and social environment and spread to the whole body. I use a video segment of a CTO event to demonstrate how to capture embodied attention by tracking head movements relative to body orientation. The proof-of-concept demonstrate how a state-space approach and the tools of sequential analysis-multiway contingency tables analysis for categorical data and timeseries analysis for continuous data representation-provides a shared framing that allows integrating the pieces of social complexity and distributed cognition into a single research program to look at socio-cognitive phenomena in other contexts and across species. Polyadic interactions offer opportunities to see inside the black boxes of social complexity and cognition. Analyzing socio-cognitive behavior at multiple levels of social complexity can be viewed as an extra-somatic extension of Senjowski \& Churchland (1990) now famous hierarchy of structural levels of brain investigation},

To address this operationalization problem, scientists often assess whether tasks engage the same neural mechanisms. To determine whether mechanisms are of the same kind, however, we need to solve the abstraction problem by determining which physical differences we can gloss over, and the boundary problem by distinguishing the mechanism from its background conditions. Solving these problems requires understanding how cognitive capacities are elicited in tasks. We argue that this ‘cycle of kinds’ is an iterative process that yields progress only incrementally.},

  abstract = {Adaptive agents must occupy a limited repertoire of states and therefore minimize the long-term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world. Minimizing surprise enables them to resist a natural tendency to disorder.Surprise rests on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. Although surprise cannot be measured directly, a free-energy bound on surprise can be, suggesting that agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action).Perception optimizes predictions by minimizing free energy with respect to synaptic activity (perceptual inference), efficacy (learning and memory) and gain (attention and salience). This furnishes Bayes-optimal (probabilistic) representations of what caused sensations (providing a link to the Bayesian brain hypothesis).Bayes-optimal perception is mathematically equivalent to predictive coding and maximizing the mutual information between sensations and the representations of their causes. This is a probabilistic generalization of the principle of efficient coding (the infomax principle) or the minimum-redundancy principle.Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those underlying cell assembly formation.Action under the free-energy principle reduces to suppressing sensory prediction errors that depend on predicted (expected or desired) movement trajectories. This provides a simple account of motor control, in which action is enslaved by perceptual (proprioceptive) predictions.Perceptual predictions rest on prior expectations about the trajectory or movement through the agent's state space. These priors can be acquired (as empirical priors during hierarchical inference) or they can be innate (epigenetic) and therefore subject to selective pressure.Predicted motion or state transitions realized by action correspond to policies in optimal control theory and reinforcement learning. In this context, value is inversely proportional to surprise (and implicitly free energy), and rewards correspond to innate priors that constrain policies.},

This ensures that agents sample the environment to maximise the evidence for their model of the world, such that exchanges with the environment are predictable and adaptive. However, the free energy account does not invoke reward or cost-functions from reinforcement-learning and optimal control theory. We therefore ask whether reward is necessary to explain adaptive behaviour. The free energy formulation uses ideas from statistical physics to explain action in terms of minimising sensory surprise. Conversely, reinforcement-learning has its roots in behaviourism and engineering and assumes that agents optimise a policy to maximise future reward. This paper tries to connect the two formulations and concludes that optimal policies correspond to empirical priors on the trajectories of hidden environmental states, which compel agents to seek out the (valuable) states they expect to encounter.},

  abstract = {This paper considers agency in the setting of embodied or active inference. In brief, we associate a sense of agency with prior beliefs about action and ask what sorts of beliefs underlie optimal behavior. In particular, we consider prior beliefs that action minimizes the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between desired states and attainable states in the future. This allows one to formulate bounded rationality as approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. We show that constructs like expected utility, exploration bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of this formulation. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding and Bayesian filtering schemes for minimizing free energy. Here, we consider variational Bayes as an alternative scheme that provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action—constraints that are remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Furthermore, this scheme contextualizes optimal decision theory and economic (utilitarian) formulations as pure inference problems. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (of softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution—that minimizes free energy. This sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behavior, such that attainable goals are afforded a higher precision or confidence. In turn, this means that optimal behavior entails a representation of confidence about outcomes that are under an agent's control.},

First the use of systems is identified as a key element in generative art. Various ideas from complexity theory are then introduced. It is noted that systems exist on a continuum from the highly ordered to the highly disordered. Citing examples from information theory and complexity science, it is noted that highly ordered and highly disordered systems are typically viewed as simple, and complex systems exhibit both order and disorder. This leads to the adoption of effective complexity, order, and disorder as organizing principles in the comparison of various generative art systems. This inclusive view leads to the somewhat surprising observation that generative art is as old as art itself. A number of specific artists and studies are discussed within this systems and complexity theory influenced paradigm. Finally a number of art theoretical questions are introduced to exercise the suggested generative art definition and implicit paradigm.},

  abstract = {The present article offers a conceptual model for how the cognitive processes associated with perspective-taking facilitate social coordination and foster social bonds. We suggest that the benefits of perspective-taking accrue through an increased self-other overlap in cognitive representations and discuss the implications of this perspective-taking induced self-other overlap for stereotyping and prejudice. Whereas perspective-taking decreases stereotyping of others (through application of the self to the other), it increases stereotypicality of one's own behavior (through inclusion of the other in the self). To promote social bonds, perspective-takers utilize information, including stereotypes, to coordinate their behavior with others. The discussion focuses on the implications, both positive and negative, of this self-other overlap for social relationships and discusses how conceptualizing perspective-taking, as geared toward supporting specific social bonds, provides a framework for understanding why the effects of perspective-taking are typically target-specific and do not activate a general helping mind-set. Through its attempts to secure social bonds, perspective-taking can be an engine of social harmony, but can also reveal a dark side, one full of ironic consequences.

Searching for the brain location of intentions, beliefs and desires—as such—might not be the best epistemic strategy to disclose what social cognition really is. The results of neurocognitive research suggest that in the brain of primates, mirror neurons, and more generally the premotor system, play a major role in several aspects of social cognition, from action and intention understanding to language processing. This evidence is presented and discussed within the theoretical frame of an embodied simulation account of social cognition. Embodied simulation and the mirror neuron system underpinning it provide the means to share communicative intentions, meaning and reference, thus granting the parity requirements of social communication.},

  abstract = {According to many philosophers and scientists, human sociality is explained by our unique capacity to “share” attitudes with others. The conditions under which mental states are shared have been widely debated in the past two decades, focusing especially on the issue of their reducibility to individual intentionality and the place of collective intentions in the natural realm. It is not clear, however, to what extent these two issues are related and what methodologies of investigation are appropriate in each case. In this article, I propose a solution that distinguishes between epistemic and ontological interpretations of the demand for the conditions of reduction of collective intentionality. While the philosophical debate has contributed important insights into the former, recent advances in the cognitive sciences offer novel resources to tackle the latter. Drawing on Michael Tomasello’s research in the ontogeny of shared intentionality in early instances of interaction based on joint attention, I propose an empirically informed argument of what it would take to address the ontological question of irreducibility, thus making a step forward in the naturalization of collective intentionality.},

In response, some have argued that by generalizing the notion of a selection process to include phenomena such as operant conditioning, and the neural selection that underlies it, we can resolve this problem. Here, we do four things: we develop this suggestion in a rigorous way through a simple example, we draw on recent neurobiological research to support its empirical plausibility, we defend the move from a host of objections in the literature, and we sketch how the picture can be extended to help us think about more complex "conceptual" representations and not just perceptual ones.},

  abstract = {Modeling mechanisms is central to the biological sciences – for purposes of explanation, prediction, extrapolation, and manipulation. A closer look at the philosophical literature reveals that mechanisms are predominantly modeled in a purely qualitative way. That is, mechanistic models are conceived of as representing how certain entities and activities are spatially and temporally organized so that they bring about the behavior of the mechanism in question. Although this adequately characterizes how mechanisms are represented in biology textbooks, contemporary biological research practice shows the need for quantitative, probabilistic models of mechanisms, too. In this chapter, we argue that the formal framework of causal graph theory is well suited to provide us with models of biological mechanisms that incorporate quantitative and probabilistic information. On the basis of an example from contemporary biological practice, namely, feedback regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis in Brassica napus, we show that causal graph theoretical models can account for feedback as well as for the multilevel character of mechanisms. However, we do not claim that causal graph theoretical representations of mechanisms are advantageous in all respects and should replace common qualitative models. Rather, we endorse the more balanced view that causal graph theoretical models of mechanisms are useful for some purposes while being insufficient for others.},

In this article, we review a suboptimal strategy – additively combining reward magnitude and reward probability attributes of options for value-based decision making. In addition, we present computational intricacies of a recently developed model (named MIX model) representing an algorithmic implementation of the additive strategy in sequential decision-making with two options. We also discuss its opportunities; and conceptual, inferential, and generalization issues. Furthermore, we suggest future studies that will reveal the potential and serve the further development of the MIX model as a general model of value-based choice making.},

But I also argue that there are good epistemological and phenomenological reasons for thinking that there is generality in perception. In particular, I focus on Brewer's purely relationalist account and I argue that it either fails to satisfy important phenomenological and epistemological requirements, or it introduces generality in a way that makes it collapse into CV. I contend that construing the debate between CV and pure relationalism in light of particularity and generality advances our understanding of how perceptual experience discloses the world to us, as well as strengthening the standing of CV.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In a complex and uncertain world, humans and animals make decisions under the constraints of limited knowledge, resources, and time. Yet models of rational decision making in economics, cognitive science, biology, and other fields largely ignore these real constraints and instead assume agents with perfect information and unlimited time. About forty years ago, Herbert Simon challenged this view with his notion of "bounded rationality." Today, bounded rationality has become a fashionable term used for disparate views of reasoning.This book promotes bounded rationality as the key to understanding how real people make decisions. Using the concept of an "adaptive toolbox," a repertoire of fast and frugal rules for decision making under uncertainty, it attempts to impose more order and coherence on the idea of bounded rationality. The contributors view bounded rationality neither as optimization under constraints nor as the study of people's reasoning fallacies. The strategies in the adaptive toolbox dispense with optimization and, for the most part, with calculations of probabilities and utilities. The book extends the concept of bounded rationality from cognitive tools to emotions; it analyzes social norms, imitation, and other cultural tools as rational strategies; and it shows how smart heuristics can exploit the structure of environments.},

Using methods of philosophy to examine such longstanding sociological questions, Margaret Gilbert gives a general characterization of the core phenomena at issue in the domain of human social life. After developing detailed analyses of a number of central everyday concepts of social phenomena--including shared action, a social convention, a group's belief, and a group itself--she proposes that the core social phenomena among human beings are "plural subject" phenomena. In her analyses Gilbert discusses the work of such thinkers as Emile Durkheim, Georg Simmel, Max Weber, and David Lewis.

«the endowment effect can be modeled as respect for private property in the absence of legal institutions ensuring third-party contract enforcement. In this sense, preinstitutional “natural” private property has been observed in many species, in the form of the recognition of territorial possession» (Gintis, 2007, p. 2)
\par
«In a private property equilibrium, since the potential contestants are of equal power, it must be the case that individuals are loss averse, the incumbent being willing to expend more resources to hold the resource than the intruder is to seize it.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 3)
\par
«Our model of decentralized private property is like the “Bourgeois” equilibrium in the Hawk, Dove, Bourgeois game, in that agents contest for a unit of an indivisible resource, contests may be very costly, and in equilibrium, incumbency determines who holds the resource without costly contests. Our model, however, fills in critical gaps in the Hawk, Dove, Bourgeois game. The central ambiguity of the Hawk, Dove, Bourgeois game is that it treats the cost of contesting as exogenously given and taking on exactly two values, high for Hawk and low for Dove. Clearly, however, these costs are in large part under the control of the agents themselves and should not be considered exogenous. In our model, the level of resources devoted to a contest is endogenously determined, and the contest itself is modeled explicitly as a modified War of Attrition, the probability of winning being a function of the level of resources committed to combat. One critical feature of the War of Attrition is that the initial commitment of a level of resources to a contest must be behaviorally ensured by the agent, so that the agent will continue to contest even when the costs of doing so exceed the fitness benefits. Without this pre-commitment, the incumbent’s threat of “fighting to the death” would not be credible (i.e., the chosen best response of the agent would not be subgame perfect). From a behavioral point of view, this pre-commitment can be summarized as the incumbent have a degree of loss aversion leading his utility to differ from his fitness.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 3)
\par
«The dominant view in Western thought, from Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Marx to the present, is that private property is a human social construction that emerged with the rise of modern civilization (Schlatter, 1973). However, evidence from studies of animal behavior, gathered mostly in the past quarter century, has shown this view to be incorrect. Various territorial claims are recognized in non-human species, including butterflies (Davies, 1978), spiders (Riechert, 1978), wild horses (Stevens, 1988), finches (Senar et al., 1989), wasps (Eason et al., 1999), non-human primates (Ellis, 1985), lizards (Rand, 1967), and many others (MestertonGibbons and Adams, 2003). There are, of course, some obvious forms of incumbent advantage that partially explain this phenomenon: the incumbent’s investment in the territory may be idiosyncratically more valuable to the incumbent than to a contestant or the incumbent’s familiarity with the territory may enhance its ability to fight. However, in the above-cited cases, these forms of incumbent advantage are unlikely to be important. Thus, a more general explanation of territoriality is needed.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 4)
\par
«The nest is quite as valuable to another sparrow couple. Why does another couple not try to evict the first?» (Gintis, 2007, p. 5)
\par
«One common argument, borrowed from Trivers (1972), is that the original couple has more to lose since it has put a good deal of effort already in the improvement of the property. This, however, is a logical error that has come to be known as the Concorde or the sunk cost fallacy (Dawkins and Brockmann, 1980; Arkes and Ayton, 1999): to maximize future returns, an agent ought consider only the future payoffs of an entity, not how much the agent has expended on the entity in the past.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 5)
\par
«The Hawk, Dove, Bourgeois game was offered by Maynard Smith and Parker (1976) as a logically sound alternative to the sunk cost argument. In this game Hawks and Doves are phenotypically indistinguishable members of the same species, but they act differently in contesting over ownership rights to a territory. When two Doves contest, they posture for a bit, and then each assumes the territory with equal probability. When a Dove and a Hawk contest, however, the Hawk takes the whole territory. Finally, when two Hawks contest, a terrible battle ensues, and the value of the territory is less than the cost of fighting for the contestants. Maynard Smith showed that, assuming that there is an unambiguous way to determine who first found the territory, there is an evolutionarily stable strategy in which all agents behave like Hawks when they are first to find the territory, and like Doves otherwise. He called this the Bourgeois strategy.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 5)
\par
«The Hawk, Dove, Bourgeois game is an elegant contribution to explaining the endowment effect, but the cost of contesting for Hawks and the cost of display for Doves cannot plausibly be taken as fixed and exogenously determined.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 5)
\par
«Long before they become acquainted with money, markets, bargaining and trade, children exhibit possessive behavior and recognize the property rights of others on the basis of incumbency.3 In one study (Bakeman and Brownlee, 1982), participant observers studied a group of 11 toddlers (12–24 months old) and a group of 13 preschoolers (40–48 months old) at a day care center. The observers found that each group was organized into a fairly consistent linear dominance hierarchy. They then cataloged possession episodes, defined as a situation in which a holder touched or held an object and a taker touched the object and attempted to remove it from the holder’s possession. Possession episodes averaged 11.7 h−1 in the toddler group, and 5.4 h−1 in the preschool group. For each possession episode, the observers noted (a) whether the taker had been playing with the object within the previous 60 s (prior possession), (b) whether the holder resisted the take attempt (resistance), and (c) whether the take was successful (success). They found that success was strongly and about equally associated with both dominance and prior possession. They also found that resistance was associated mainly with dominance in the toddlers, and with prior possession in the preschoolers. They suggest that toddlers recognize possession as a basis for asserting control rights, but do not respect the same rights in others. The preschoolers, more than twice the age of the toddlers, use physical proximity both to justify their own claims and to respect the claims of others. This study was replicated and extended by Weigel (1984).» (Gintis, 2007, p. 6)
\par
«In a famous paper, Maynard Smith and Parker noted that two animals are competing for some resource (e.g., a territory), and if there is some discernible asymmetry (e.g., between an “owner” and a later animal), then it is evolutionarily stable for the asymmetry to settle the contest conventionally, without fighting. Among the many animal behaviorists who put this theory to the test, perhaps none is more elegant and unambiguous than Davies, who studied the speckled wood (Pararge aegeria), a butterfly found in the Wytham Woods, near Oxford, England. Territories for this butterfly are shafts of sunlight breaking through the tree canopy. Males occupying these spots enjoyed heightened mating success, and on average only 60\% of males occupied the sunlit spots at any one time. A vacant spot was generally occupied within seconds, but an intruder on an already occupied spot was invariably driven away, even if the incumbent had occupied the spot only for a few seconds. When Davies “tricked” two butterflies into thinking each had occupied the sunny patch first, the contest between the two lasted, on average, ten times as long as the brief flurry that occurs when an incumbent chases off an intruder.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 6)
\par
«Let πg be the present value of being a currently uncontested incumbent, and let πb be the present value of being a migrant searching for a territory. We assume throughout that πg {$>$} πb {$>$} 0.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 8)
\par
«Suppose a migrant comes upon an occupied territory. Should the migrant contest, the condition under which it pays an incumbent to fight back is then given by πc ≡ pd(1 − pu)πg + pdpu(1 − β)(1 − c)πb + (1 − pd)(1 − pu)πg + (1 − pd)puπb(1 − c) {$>$}πb(1 − c). The first term in πc is the product of the probabilities that the intruder loses (1 − pu) and sustains an injury (pd), times the value πg of incumbency, which the incumbent then retains. The second term is the product of the probabilities that the incumbent loses (pu), sustains an injury (pd), survives the injury (1 − β), and survives the passage to migrant status (1 − c), times the present value πb of being a migrant. The third and fourth terms are the parallel calculations when no injury is sustained. This inequality simplifies to πg πb(1 − c) − 1 {$>$} sn u sn o s.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 8)
\par
«A private property equilibrium occurs when both inequalities obtain: sn o sn u s{$>$} πg πb(1 − c) − 1 {$>$} sn u sn o s.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 9)
\par
«Theorem 1. If πg {$>$}(1+β)πb(1 − c) there is a unique equilibrium in which an migrant always fights for possession and an incumbent always contests. When the reverse inequality holds, there exists both a private property equilibrium and an anti-private property equilibrium.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 9)
\par
«Humans share with many other species a predisposition to recognize private property. This takes the form of loss aversion: an incumbent is prepared to commit more vital resources to defending his property, ceteris paribus, than an intruder is willing to commit to taking the property. The major proviso is that if the property is sufficiently valuable, a private property equilibrium will not exist (Theorem 1). History is written as though private property is a product of modern civilization, a construction that exists only to the extent that it is defined and protected by judicial institutions operating according to legal notions of ownership. However, it is likely that private property in the fruits of one’s labour existed for as long as humans lived in small hunter–gatherer clans, unless the equality in Theorem 1 holds, as might plausibly be the case for big game. The true value of modern private property, if the argument in this paper is valid, is fostering the accumulation property even when πg {$>$}(1+β)πb(1 − c). It is in this sense only that Thomas Hobbes may have been correct in asserting that life in an unregulated state of nature is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” But even so, it must be recognized that modern notions of property are built on human behavioral propensities that we share with many species of non-human animals. Doubtless, an alien species with a genetic organization akin to our ants or termites would find our notions of individuality and privacy curious at best, and probably incomprehensible.» (Gintis, 2007, p. 15)},

  abstract = {This book argues for a new image of nature and of science—one that understands both natural and social phenomena to be the product of mechanisms, and that suggests that much of the work of natural and social scientists involves discovering, describing, and explaining how these mechanisms work. The book explores the interplay between ontological questions about mechanisms as things in the world and methodological questions about how these mechanisms can be characterized. Ontologically, mechanisms are understood to be collections of entities whose organized activities and interactions give rise to phenomena. This minimal conception of mechanism is abstract enough to encompass most of the wide variety of things that scientists have called mechanisms. While mechanisms are particular things, localized in space and time, the models that scientists use to describe them must be abstract and idealized. The mechanistic approach provides new ways of thinking about traditional metaphysical questions—for instance, about the nature of objects, part-whole and cause-effect relations, properties and universals, natural kinds, and laws of nature. It also suggests novel approaches for thinking about methodological questions concerning scientific representation, causal inference, reduction, and scientific explanation. The New Mechanical Philosophy offers the promise of a better understanding of the sources of both the unity and diversity of science.},

Dretske, Fodor and many others think that some organisms, including people, contain inner states and structures which represent the world, and do so as a matter of objective fact. Philosophy should aim to describe the connections between facts about the use of difficult and controversial concepts, and facts about the parts of the world that the concepts are in some sense aimed at dealing with. Philosophy should link the empirical facts about human knowledge-ascriptions with the facts about how beliefs are regulated and how beliefs enable organisms to get around the world. From the point of view of Dennett's picture, the Dretske–Fodor view is mistaken because it does not take seriously the special properties of human interpretive practices; interpretation is not just an attempt to lay out the hidden structure of a complex machine. The first point that should be clear is that one needs more empirical knowledge about folk psychological interpretation.},

  abstract = {The two essays in this classic work by sociologist Erving Goffman deal with the calculative, gamelike aspects of human interaction. Goffman examines the strategy of words and deeds; he uses the term \&quot;strategic interaction\&quot; to describe gamelike events in which an individual\&\#39;s situation is fully dependent on the move of one\&\#39;s opponent and in which both players know this and have the wit to use this awareness for advantage. Goffman aims to show that strategic interaction can be isolated analytically from the general study of communication and face-to-face interaction. The first essay addresses expression games, in which a participant spars to discover the value of information given openly or unwittingly by another. The author uses vivid examples from espionage literature and high-level political intrigue to show how people mislead one another in the information game. Both observer and observed create evidence that is false and uncover evidence that is real. In \&quot;Strategic Interaction,\&quot; the book\&\#39;s second essay, action is the central concern, and expression games are secondary. Goffman makes clear that often, when it seems that an opponent sets off a course of action through verbal communication, he really has a finger on your trigger, your chips on the table, or your check in his bank. Communication may reinforce conduct, but in the end, action speaks louder. Those who gamble with their wits, and those who study those who do, will find this analysis important and stimulating.},

We identify classes of coordination games in which coordination cannot be guaranteed in a single round, but can eventually be achieved in several rounds by following suitable coordination protocols. In particular, we study coordination using protocols invariant under structural symmetries of games under some natural assumptions, such as: priority hierarchies amongst players, different patience thresholds, use of focal groups, and gradual coordination by contact.},

Part IV debates human and artificial intelligence and, finally, Part V deliberates about the computation and the ethics of big data and artificial intelligence.The book contains valuable material for researchers in several fields such as~Cognitive Science and Neuroscience, Psychology and Artificial Intelligence, and Philosophy. It can also be used as a guide to some courses at various levels, from BAs to MAs and PhD courses of several fields.

At intermediate cost levels, the conventions coexist.

The use of optimization programs permits a clear statement of what this belief should be understood to mean, in contradistinction to the common mathematical presumption that it should be formalized as some kind of Lyapunov or even potential function. The argument reveals new details and uncovers latent assumptions. A very general genetic architecture is allowed, and there is arbitrary uncertainty. However, frequency dependence of fitnesses is not permitted. The logic of inclusive fitness immediately draws together various kinds of intra-genomic conflict, and the concept of ‘p-family’ is introduced. Inclusive fitness is thus incorporated into the formal Darwinism project, which aims to link the mathematics of motion (difference and differential equations) used to describe gene frequency trajectories with the mathematics of optimization used to describe purpose and design. Important questions remain to be answered in the fundamental theory of inclusive fitness.},

They could not communicate or see each other and thus had to accurately predict each other's choices to succeed. One division split the rewards evenly, while the others each favored one child. Five-year-olds mostly chose the division favorable to themselves, resulting in coordination failure. By contrast, 7-year-olds mostly coordinated successfully by choosing the division that split the rewards equally (even though they behaved selfishly in a control condition in which they could choose independently). This suggests that by age 7, children jointly expect benefits to be shared among interdependent social partners "fairly" and that fair compromises can emanate from a cooperative rationality adapted for social coordination. © 2020 American Psychological Association.},

Philosophers have typically conceived of such debates as pre-scientific attempts to reform social scientific practice, rather than as post-scientific reflections on a firm body of scientific knowledge. Two celebrated contemporary research programs in social ontology – collective intentionality and evolutionary game theory – also follow this approach. In this paper I illustrate their central elements and criticize their weak empirical foundations. I finish by reviewing some work that combines empirical evidence with theoretical reflection, and suggest that it constitutes the way forward in the philosophy of social science.},

"Far from being a part of it, the philosophy of social science often stands in polemic contraposition with standard philosophy of science, which is accused of being excessively natural science-centric and hence unable to shed light on the peculiarities of social science research. The counterpart for much current philosophy of social science thus would be a generic 'philosophy of natural science' (as opposed to the specific philosophies of physics, biology, chemistry) which, however, does not exist." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=1}{Guala 2007:954})
\par
"Given their pragmatic preference for the scientific worldview, it is not surprising that many post-Quinean philosophers of science see their work in continuity, rather than in competition, with science. 'Good' (highly confirmed, successful) science is their point of departure, and their job is entirely post-scientific: to clarify the ontological commitments of our best theories. Many successful scientific theories in fact are far from ontologically transparent and raise difficult interpretative questions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=3}{Guala 2007:956})
\par
"This approach to ontology takes science for granted, or at least does not question the results of our best scientific disciplines. It is, however, a non-starter in the social sciences, because according to many scientists and philosophers these are neither highly confirmed nor successful scientific disciplines." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=3}{Guala 2007:956})
\par
"Ontology is still the central area of investigation in the philosophy of social science - and it is safe to forecast that it will continue to be for quite a while. A few important events however have shifted the focus of the debate considerably over the last decade or so, both at the level of topics and style of discussion. First is the emergence of a theoretical framework that is becoming increasingly influential and is likely to replace soon the categories that were central in the 'old' debates (individualism and holism, agency and structure, etc.). I shall call it the Standard Model of Social Ontology, and describe it briefly in section 3 below." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=3}{Guala 2007:956})
\par
"The new rational choice approach is not a step forward in the naturalization of the philosophy of social science. Indeed, it is worrying that the two leading new frameworks in the philosophy of social science (the Standard Model and evolutionary game theory) are united in tackling what are essentially empirical questions from an a priori viewpoint." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=4}{Guala 2007:957})
\par
"first, Lewis is usually credited for providing the first analysis of social conventions as systems of self-sustaining beliefs. And secondly, Convention provided the first paradigmatic example of how rational choice analysis could be put to work in the area of social ontology." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=4}{Guala 2007:957})
\par
"If coordination is not achieved, everybody in the relevant group will be worse off. A team of footballers in this sense are playing an incredibly complex coordination game, and so are the members of an orchestra, the drivers on the road, or the people who wear black at a Sicilian funeral." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=5}{Guala 2007:958})
\par
"Lewis had the idea of modeling conventions as indefinitely repeated coordination games, where the focal point is determined by history. We drive on the left because everybody has driven on the left up until now; ditto for wearing black at funerals" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=5}{Guala 2007:958})
\par
"This approach to the study of conventions is remarkable in many respects. First, it demonstrates the power of simple game theoretic ideas applied to problems of social ontology. But interestingly, it also highlights some fundamental limitations of the rational choice approach." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=6}{Guala 2007:959})
\par
"Schelling saw clearly that it is impossible to give a purely gametheoretic account of people's behavior when it is driven by the existence of focal points. The bare game-theoretic version of the left/right driving problem, or of the ten numbers puzzle, is simply unsolvable from a traditional game-theoretic perspective. There are ten different pure Nash equilibria in the numbers puzzle (we both choose zero, we both choose one, etc.), and the theory is unable to tell us which one is best for predictive purposes. Schelling openly advocated that the a priori approach of game theory be supplemented by a study of the formation of focal points, a task for empirical psychology and sociology, because different aspects of the world are likely to become salient in different cultures and societies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=6}{Guala 2007:959})
\par
"A key insight in Lewis's theory is that social conventions are a complex system of self-sustaining beliefs and preferences (or beliefs and preferences in equilibrium), and common knowledge is a crucial condition for such equilibria to exist" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=6}{Guala 2007:959})
\par
"Lewis's theory is distinctive for its insistence that conventions are non-normative, i.e., that they imply no other obligation except those that arise from individual self-interest and rationality.6 The theory then leads naturally to a rather neat separation between social norms and conventions. A social norm always comes with an intrinsic 'ought', and is usually backed up by a system of informal" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=6}{Guala 2007:959})
\par
"sanctions or formal punishments. The sanctions are meant to change the payoffs of the game: for example, to change a mixed-motives game (like a prisoner's dilemma) into a coordination game (Fig. 1).7" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=7}{Guala 2007:960})
\par
"Roughly, then, a social norm exists when every individual (1) prefers to conform to the norm provided that (almost) everybody else does the same; and (2) it is common knowledge that one ought to conform.8 This is the backbone of the game-theoretic account of reflexivity as applied to norms. Institutions are systems of conventions, norms, and rules, where by 'rules' I just mean precisely stated norms as codified in laws, contracts, etc. that are usually policed and enforced by means of explicitly defined sanctions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=7}{Guala 2007:960})
\par
"Another important element in Lewis is the central role played by history and evolution. Conventions are the outcome of repeated coordination games. Without precedence there would be no focal points, and no convergence on a common solution. This idea - that several problems that are intractable in a one-shot game can be solved in repeated play - is important and has been fully exploited by the evolutionary approach to social ontology." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=7}{Guala 2007:960})
\par
"'Standard Model of Social Ontology' (SMOSO). SMOSO can be characterized as an attempt to articulate the individualistic foundations of social phenomena. SMOSO however imposes only a mildly individualistic restriction on social ontology: 'Basic Ontological Intuition: if all individuals were to disappear, all social institutions would disappear too.'" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=8}{Guala 2007:961})
\par
"SMOSO is constituted by three elements: reflexivity, performativity, and collective intentionality.11 These elements have different origins and have been assembled only relatively recently. Notice that not all philosophers who work within the framework of SMOSO necessarily subscribe to all three theses." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=8}{Guala 2007:961})
\par
"Reflexivity: this is the idea that social entities are constituted by beliefs about beliefs. We have already mentioned that the game-theoretic version of this idea goes back to Lewis (1969). Earlier discussions can be found in the debate on 'self-fulfilling prophecies'." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=8}{Guala 2007:961})
\par
"The Mertonian approach sees reflexivity mainly as a threat, both for society and for social science: for society, because it may lead to disastrous results such as the failure of a financially sound bank; for social science, because it blurs the boundary between what scientists say about reality and reality itself, and in many cases is an obstacle towards the use of social science for the prediction of future events. Others however have highlighted the positive, constructive side of this crucial phenomenon. Herbert Simon (1957) showed that in every reflexive situation it is possible in principle to formulate an 'equilibrium' prediction that will be fulfilled by the actions of the individuals involved. Daya Krishna (1971) pointed out that social reality itself is the result of a massive and extraordinarily complex series of self-fulfilling prophecies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=9}{Guala 2007:962})
\par
"As a rule, most social entities/phenomena/facts stand upon layers of social structure. A certain behavior (say, exchanging a piece of paper for a piece of bread) counts as purchasing food only because that piece of paper counts as money; this in turn is the case because the paper has been produced in a factory according to a process directed and supervised by people who count as employees of an entity called the 'Bank of England'. The Bank of England itself of course stands on complex layers of social facts, and so on and on. This iterative character of performativity and social reality is most vividly captured by John Searle's slogan: 'X counts as Y in C'. Although the first Xs at the bottom of the social structure must presumably be non-social (physical) entities,12 a complex social structure consists of a series of successive iterations such as 'Y counts as Z in D', 'Z counts as W in E', and so on." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=9}{Guala 2007:962})
\par
"Tuomela (1984; 1995; 2002) and Gilbert (1989) first pointed out that the reflexive beliefs that constitute the stuff of social reality are most naturally formulated in we-mode.13 They have also argued that it is impossible to reduce these we-beliefs to I-beliefs without losing some of the intrinsically 'social' character of the institutional reality they contribute to bring about. Their slogan could be: No social reality without collective intentionality. In recent years they have been joined in the debate by John Searle (1990; 1995), Michael Bratman (1993), and others. Robert Sugden (2000) has recently pointed out that from the point of view of rational choice theory, collective intentions stand on a ground that is as firm as that of individual intentions. Others disagree and propose analyses of social norms that are entirely in I-mode (e.g., Bicchieri 2006)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=10}{Guala 2007:963})
\par
"Collective intentionality, if taken as a primitive notion, is sometimes used to make common knowledge redundant: social entities are constituted by first-order beliefs (in the we-mode), rather than by beliefs about beliefs (in the I-mode). Others try to reduce collective intentionality to common knowledge and I-intentions, and yet others combine collective intentions with common knowledge in their ontologies."

"Since there are many games with multiple equilibria, this is a generalized problem for epistemic game theory - the problem of 'equilibrium selection', as it is known in the literature." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=11}{Guala 2007:964})
\par
"An evolutionarily stable strategy identifies an equilibrium that is resistant to 'invasions' by single 'mutants', i.e., by players who play different strategies." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=11}{Guala 2007:964})
\par
"A key assumption in evolutionary games, then, is that successful strategies spread in the population. In biology, the concept of 'success' is cashed out in terms of evolutionary fitness, i.e., the expected number of offspring of an individual carrying a given trait. When evolutionary game theory is applied in the social sciences, economists however prefer to stick to the old notion of utility. The problem then is that we need a mechanism showing how high utility-bearing strategies spread in a population. Under the fitness interpretation, this result can be turned into a tautology: when the game is repeated long enough, the strategy that spreads in the population is the one with the highest fitness coefficient.17 In the utility interpretation, in contrast, one ought to show that successful (utility-maximizing) strategies are somehow imitated by the other players until they become prevalent in the population." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=12}{Guala 2007:965})
\par
"We have seen that according to Lewis conventions are intrinsically non-normative. Although it may be 'externally' supported by other social norms, in other words, following a convention does not imply per se a commitment to a particular course of action, except in so far as it is prescribed by individual instrumental rationality. Other philosophers disagree. Margaret Gilbert (1989) for example argues forcefully that conventions carry an intrinsic normative force of their own. They are akin to 'quasi-agreements', which cannot be unilaterally breached by one party without the others' permission." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=13}{Guala 2007:966})
\par
"it is representative of the general methodology followed by Gilbert and many other philosophers in this debate: ontological issues are to be resolved by means of linguistic analysis and intuition. This is, however, a problematic approach. Let us look back at the quotation: would we say that there is a convention to have tea at four, or not? The honest answer, I believe, is 'I don't know'. Our language just does not constrain the usage of terms like 'convention' enough for there being a definite answer to this question." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=13}{Guala 2007:966})
\par
"What Tuomela and Gilbert are saying (although not in so many words) is that ontological investigation is similar to scientific research after all: theorizing must be complemented by (and ultimately tested against) empirical evidence of some kind. Of course a lot of the examples that philosophers use are 'empirical' broadly speaking. (Searle's recurrent example of the social construction of money is a case in point.) But this sort of generic 'stylized facts', as economists would call them, carry a limited amount of useful information and can only take the ontological investigation thus far. In order to make further progress, more powerful tools of empirical investigation must enter the scene." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=15}{Guala 2007:968})
\par
"An advantage of evolutionary game theory is that it features relatively 'dumb' players. In biological models, animal behavior is often supposed to be entirely dictated by genetic factors. Indeed, the tighter the relationship between a single gene and behavior, the better, for modeling purposes. This strictly genetic-deterministic version leads to a sharp break with epistemic rational choice theory, but unfortunately is not very plausible in social-scientific applications. The reason has to do with the already-mentioned interpretation of fitness: whereas in biological models the spread of 'good' traits can be turned into a tautology, in social scientific models we need to find a persuasive connection between 'good' strategies (norms, conventions) and their dissemination in the population." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=16}{Guala 2007:969})
\par
"A favorite of evolutionary game theorists is the socalled replicator dynamics mechanisms. According to replicator dynamics, roughly, the number of individuals in a population who follow a given strategy at a given point in time is proportional to how well the individuals playing that strategy have done in the past (in utility terms), and in particular to how much better they have done compared to the average utility payoff in the population as a whole." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=16}{Guala 2007:969})
\par
"Unless one is willing to endorse an overly restrictive definition of science, however, the foundations of evolutionary game theory are not so scientific after all. They are theoretical, surely, but lacking solid empirical foundations the relevant theory is no more scientific than the philosophical theories it is supposed to replace. It is once again metaphysics - carried out by other means, perhaps, but metaphysics nonetheless." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=17}{Guala 2007:970})
\par
"Robert Sugden pioneered the application of evolutionary game theory to the ontology of social norms (Sugden 1986). In The Economics of Rights, Cooperation and Welfare and in later work, he has tried to stick as close as possible to the lessons of Schelling and Lewis. In particular, he has argued that no a priori account of convention can explain the generation of salience and focal points. He has also criticized the assumption, implicit in much of game theory, that players see the world (and their problem-situation) in the same way as the theorist. If this is true, in order to derive any implications about what another player (or players) will do next, each player must interpret their past behavior to find out what their worldview is. Behavior is not a strategy: one must infer what another player intended to do (whether for instance she was trying to cooperate or defect) from what she actually did. But unless one knows how she saw the game that was played, it is impossible to identify what strategy she has been following so far. And of course one cannot project her behavior in the future (see in particular Sugden 1998)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=18}{Guala 2007:971})
\par
"It is wellknown to experimenters that to frame a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma as a cooperative task triggers immediately an increase in the actual cooperation of players. In this case, subjects have no past evidence to hang on to: instead of engaging in inductive calculations they simply react to the experimental cue, and implicitly assume that the others will read the situation in the same way. These mechanisms not only defy an analysis in terms of pure rational choice, but also show how an a priori approach is likely to miss the most important and interesting part of the story of how institutions emerge and are sustained in the real world." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=19}{Guala 2007:972})
\par
"A signal that triggers a norm of cooperation in one culture may trigger a norm of gift-giving in another.28 This is partly because single norms usually rest on several layers of social reality (X counts as Y, Y counts as W, . . . ), and partly because as we have seen the same categories support different inductive inferences in different cultures. For these reasons the sparse histories of evolutionary game theory - which usually start from a fictional state of nature where conventions and norms are totally absent - cannot throw much light on the real mechanisms that sustain institutional construction. We need 'thick' stories in order to do that." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=19}{Guala 2007:972})
\par
"Unlike natural-kind terms, however, social kinds are interactive: the very people who are classified react to the classification in ways that are only partly predictable. People react by changing the way they see themselves, their identities, goals, and role in society." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GQASX36Q?page=20}{Guala 2007:973})
\par
"Apart from the intrinsic interest of this story, MacKenzie's study highlights a fact of primary philosophical significance. The complex construction (and destruction) of social reality is heavily dependent not only on mechanisms and processes at the individual level. Cognitive factors of course play a central role in social ontology, and philosophers' analyses in terms of preference-belief intentionality do capture an essential part of the story. But equally important is to understand the ways in which our desires and beliefs are aided, enhanced, channeled, and constrained by social and physical technology."

", e evolutionary program —as the term will be used from now on—is a descendant of the human ethology of Lorentz and Tinbergen of the 1234s, and of the sociobiology of E. O. Wilson of the 1254s. It partly overlaps with evolutionary psychology, evolutionary anthropology, and evolutionary game theory—three major research programs that have extended the legacy of sociobiology in the 1264s and the 1224s (cf. Gri7 ths 8446 ). Last, but not least, the evolutionary program aims to shed light on the origins of "fair" social contracts of the sort philosophers have theorized from the time of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, to contemporary theorists like John Rawls."

"Solutions to the puzzle of cooperation can be classi9 ed in two broad categories: those that change the structure of the game and those that change the way the game is played. Approaches of the latter kind are particularly popular among those who 9 nd the classic description of economic agents (based on rationality and self-interest) implausible or distasteful: Surely only sel9 sh economic agents defect in dilemma games, while the rest of us—"the folk"—can do much better than that. But this view is simplistic. Far from being an arbitrary assumption, the self-interest principle is well-rooted in evolutionary theorizing. Indeed, cooperation is in many ways more puzzling from a biological than from an economic point of view." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UAVJNZ8T?page=5}{Guala 2012:5})

Furthermore, it abandons the requirement of perfect rationality that is central in classic game theory, and models players as relatively "dumb" automata that do not engage in chains of interactive reasoning ("I prefer D to C, he knows that I prefer D to C, I know that he knows .8.8.

"7 e implications of Hamilton's rule extend beyond the theory of kin selection and the evolution of altruistic genes. Let us interpret the variables c and b more generally as the expected cost/bene8 t of a cooperative act (strategy C) in a dilemma game. What makes cooperation pro8 table is a high probability of meeting a cooperator, rather than genetic relatedness per se. Hamilton's rule therefore can be rewritten in generalized form as c {$<$} π b , where the coe9 cient π represents the probability that the other player will cooperate. A statistical correlation that biases encounters so that each player has a higher chance of meeting a similar partner than a player of a di: erent kind is called assortativity . Assortativity plays a central role in so-called structural evolutionary models, and simulations have shown that in some cases even a slight statistical bias can enhance the probability that a cooperative strategy will spread in the population by making it less vulnerable to invasion by free riders (Skyrms ;{$<<$}= , 6{$>>$}5 ; Alexander 6{$>>$}? ). Structural models give a slightly more optimistic message than kin selection: Cooperation may thrive not only within the family, but also in the small community of neighbors that we encounter frequently in our everyday dealings."

"Informally, the folk theorem says that any strategy guaranteeing more than the worst payo@ that can be inA icted by the other player is a Nash equilibrium in an in9 nitely repeated game. 8 e intuition is simple: 8 e threat of retaliation (by withdrawing cooperation) makes mutual cooperation advantageous, if the shadow of the future is long enough."

"How do we select, among all the possible equilibria, the one that will be actually played? Evolutionary game theory, again, may come to the rescue. Some evolutionary philosophers—notably Allan Gibbard ( :;;= ), Ken Binmore ( :;;{$<$} ) and Brian Skyrms ( C==6 )—have argued that the inde9 nitely repeated prisoner's dilemma game is, at roots, nothing but a coordination game. 8 e argument goes as follows: If many strategies are equilibria in the inde9 nitely repeated prisoner's dilemma, the problem the agents are facing is conceptually similar to a coordination game in which the allocation of the fruits of cooperation is at stake. If they coordinate on "always defect," the fruits will be meager; if they coordinate on "always cooperate" the players will produce more. But there are going to be intermediate solutions as well." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UAVJNZ8T?page=8}{Guala 2012:8})

"When the ultimatum game is played for real, however, fair allocations = gure prominently. Experiments in North America and Western Europe result in average o{$>$} ers between AB and 6B percent of the cake, and a mode at the CB-CB split. Rejections are in the region of ;B-AB percent, usually in response to unfair o{$>$} ers. In Japan and Israel the mode of player 8's o{$>$} ers goes down to 6B percent (Roth et al. 8998 ). Among the Au people of Papua New Guinea, the modal o{$>$} er is in the region of AB percent, and among the Hadza of West Africa it is as low as ;B percent. {$<$} e Machiguenga in Peru make the lowest o{$>$} ers observed in the ultimatum game so far (8C percent) (Henrich et al. ;BB6 ). So it seems that while fairness norms play some role in these contexts, no single o{$>$} er rate reD ects a universal feature of human sociality. On the one hand, bargaining seems to reD ect the balance of power; on the other, it seems to be inD uenced by local norms of fairness."

"In the reciprocity controversy unfortunately the evidence pulls in opposite directions depending on which source (and which issue) one focuses on. ; ere is no doubt that strong reciprocity theorists have scored a number of points on the theoretical front. ; e experimental evidence refuting standard models of cooperation is overwhelming, and the error argument largely misses the target. Yet the implications of this theoretical success are far from clear on the policy front. Elinor Ostrom—winner of the 788{$<$} Nobel Prize for economics—has led the most sustained attempt to understand the functioning of public good institutions so far, using both experimental and : eld data. While her experimental evidence con: rms that agents' motives are heterogeneous and depart substantially from those modeled on standard biological and economic theories, her study of naturally evolved institutions has provided insights that are largely consistent with those of the standard theories (Ostrom 9{$<<$}8 , 7898 ; Poteete, Jaansen, and Ostrom 7898 ). ; e same message comes from the : eld data gathered by economic historians and anthropologists who have studied the emergence of spontaneous cooperation in a variety of di= erent cultures and epochs (see Guala 7897 , for an opinionated survey)."

«A salient strategy constitutes a focal point that facilitates coordination when purely rational considerations are insufficient to identify the best move. Focal points may be determined by cultural, cognitive, or even biological factors. Lewis argued that in the case of conventions salience is determined by precedence.» (Guala, 2013, p. 3)
\par
«we say “cat” rather than “tac” because we want to be understood by our interlocutors; we wear black at funerals because we want to communicate our grief. Knowing these motivations, other individuals form expectations regarding our future moves. But these are non-normative (or “plain”) expectationsthey concern what other players will, rather than what they ought to do.» (Guala, 2013, p. 3)
\par
«In contrast a convention in Lewis’ sense does not, per se, imply a commitment to conform to the salient strategy. Lewis’ expectations are “plain” expectations, to use Gilbert’s (1989) expression, non-normative expectations about what others will do (as rational individuals), rather than what they ought to do.» (Guala, 2013, p. 4)
\par
«This neat distinction however seems to clash with Lewis’ own account. In a convoluted section, Lewis argues that “conventions may be a species of norms” (1969, p. 97 emphasis in original).» (Guala, 2013, p. 4)
\par
«Lewis goes on to say that failure to conform is likely to elicit negative reactions from the other players, and perhaps even sanctions. So Lewis Conventions look a lot like norms, all things considered.» (Guala, 2013, p. 5)
\par
«Yet, an important difference remains. While social norms are intrinsically normative (you should not steal, even if it is in your interest to do so), conventions are not. The normative power of Lewis’ conventions relies on two “external” sources: on the one hand, the normativity of conventions is the “ought” of instrumental rationality. On the other, it is the “ought” of norms that prescribe not to damage other individuals, other things being equal (or absent a countervailing reason to do so). One follows a convention because (a) it is individually rational to do so, and (b) deviance from conventions is prohibited by other independent moral principles or social norms.» (Guala, 2013, p. 5)
\par
«In particular, conventions result from a “quasi-agreement” among members of a group to pursue a certain line of action that will attain a collective goal. Such quasi-agreements need not be formulated explicitly, and often derive from the mere observation that people do pursue a certain line of action that serves the goals of the relevant group. Collective intentions result in a joint commitment that cannot be unilaterally breached by an individual group member. This is why, according to Gilbert, we usually feel the need to excuse and justify a breach of convention in front of other group members. One of Gilbert’s complaints is that “conventions in Lewis’ sense do not seem apt to give rise to the ‘ought’ judgments typically associated with conventions as ordinarily conceived” (1989, p. 354).» (Guala, 2013, p. 5)
\par
«As a matter of fact in the laboratory less than one-third (29 \%) of the potential deviants decide to breach the convention. This may sound remarkably low, but it is consistent with a substantial body of experimental data.» (Guala, 2013, p. 11)
\par
«When players build a history of joint action, they unintendedly create an additional pressure towards conformity that goes beyond the “ought” of individual rationality and other-regarding external norms. Whether these additional normative expectations are to be explained by a joint commitment (Gilbert 1989) or some other mechanism (Bicchieri 2006) is an important question that we do not know how to answer yet.» (Guala, 2013, p. 14)
\par
«For the time being, we can say that Lewis’ model overlooks these processes and provides only a partial account of the ontology of conventions.» (Guala, 2013, p. 14)
\par
«The data suggest that Lewis Conventions tend to acquire intrinsic normative force through repeated play, and any future model will have to account for these results. Their implications are non-trivial, both in the theoretical and practical realm. Here I will just mention one: the intrinsic normativity of conventions implies that habits and customs may be more difficult to disrupt than a pure rational choice analysis suggests. While individuals do react to incentives, they also display a remarkable reluctance to abandon traditional equilibria once they are in place. Experimental evidence has important implications for social policy, social ontology, and political philosophy alike.» (Guala, 2013, p. 14)},

We argue that these two approaches can be unified within an encompassing theory based on the notion of correlated equilibrium.

We then criticize Searle's claim that constitutive rules of the form ‘X counts as Y in C’ are fundamental building blocks for institutions, showing that such rules can be derived from regulative rules by introducing new institutional terms. Institutional terms are introduced for economy of thought, but are not necessary for the creation of social reality.},

  abstract = {Hindriks’ paper raises two issues: one is formal and concerns the notion of ‘cost’ in rational choice accounts of norms; the other is substantial and concerns the role of expectations in the modification of payoffs. In this commentary I express some doubts and worries especially about the latter: What’s so special with shared expectations? Why do they induce compliance with norms, if transgression is not associated with sanctions?},

"I have offered some tentative remarks on normativity elsewhere (Guala 2015; 2016), albeit in a slightly evasive way. In Understanding Institutions (2016) I have claimed that the normative power of institutions is unlikely to be backed up by a single mechanism. My argument is broadly evolutionary: norms are hugely important for the flourishing of our species, and we know that nature likes to select for the redundancy of important traits. So it is plausible that social norms are supported by a variety of different mechanisms." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L4QLQTBY?page=1}{Guala 2019:375})},

"homo sapiens is able to form strong bonds with genetically unrelated individuals, to flexibly enter and exit social relations, to imagine and implement different types of organization as required by new circumstances and needs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=1}{Guala 2020:149})
\par
"In light of all this, it is tempting to infer that our capacity to coordinate must be due to our unique cognitive skills. But this claim turns out to be problematic. There are reasons to believe that being too clever may actually hamper rather than help coordination." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=2}{Guala 2020:150})
\par
"The cognitive skills required to converge on the Nash equilibria of some games, however, seem extremely demanding: coordination for example may require the capacity to examine several orders of nested beliefs ('I believe that you believe that I believe that you believe ...')." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=2}{Guala 2020:150})
\par
"An obvious way to solve this puzzle is to revise the original assumption: perhaps being too clever does not help. Perhaps we are able to coordinate smoothly in spite of our remarkable cognitive skills, not because of them. But this raises a number of questions: what kind of cognitive mechanisms facilitate coordination? What mix of sophisticated and naïve thinking is involved? Is it possible to build a general account of the cognitive basis of coordination?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=2}{Guala 2020:150})
\par
"n spite of the appearances, it is difficult to explain coordination in Hi-lo games. Choosing Lo is not irrational: as a matter of fact, it is optimal if the other player chooses Lo, and neither player can rule that out a priori." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=4}{Guala 2020:152})
\par
"if we cannot prove that choosing Lo is irrational, then we cannot prove that choosing Hi is uniquely rational either." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=4}{Guala 2020:152})
\par
"The Hi-lo paradox is that both equilibria are rationalisable, in the sense that each one is implied by a certain configuration of initial beliefs. But, for each of them, we lack an explanation of how the players could come to have the beliefs that are necessary to play that equilibrium. This is particularly disturbing for the Hi equilibrium, which seems intuitively to be the right choice." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=5}{Guala 2020:153})
\par
"Schelling noticed that individual decisions are facilitated by the existence of focal points. He also remarked that a focal point is often salient for reasons that have little to do with the strategic features of the game, but depend on properties of the environment that should be irrelevant from a purely logical point of view." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=6}{Guala 2020:154})
\par
"When they coordinate, people do not just pick the first option that comes to mind, but the first one that will help solve the problem they are facing. Cognitive hierarchy theory therefore seems to be on the wrong track. Perhaps (some, or many) people do spend time thinking about the mental states of others; but if so, they do not simply try to predict the first option that comes to mind." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=8}{Guala 2020:156})
\par
"Another way to put it is to say that Schelling salience is a form of engaged reasoning. It presupposes that the players take a first-person perspective, the perspective of someone who is participating in a joint task. In contrast, primary salience is the perspective of a solipsistic decision-maker, and secondary salience is the perspective of an observer who is trying to predict the behaviour of a solipsistic decisionmaker. But contrary to cognitive hierarchy theory, few people seem to take such a detached perspective when they are playing coordination games." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=9}{Guala 2020:157})
\par
"Morton says that solution thinking is a special kind of simulation. What makes it distinctive is that people do not try to identify the beliefs of the other players at the outset, as a preliminary step to the identification of the equilibrium of the game. Rather, they first identify the solution, and then derive players' beliefs from it. In this sense, solution thinking breaches a key assumption of traditional folk psychology and epistemic game theory, namely, that behaviour is predicted from beliefs and desires. Instead, in solution thinking beliefs are inferred from goals and means." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=13}{Guala 2020:161})
\par
"Still, the point is: why should beliefs be attributed at all? Beliefs can be inferred by simulation thinking (from our desire to coordinate) if it is necessary. But for the sake of coordination it is probably unnecessary. Belief-less reasoning will do the job just as well. This claim clearly is at odds with traditional views about the function of beliefs, which have dominated philosophy and rational choice theory for decades." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=13}{Guala 2020:161})
\par
"Empirical evidence and theoretical considerations suggest an intriguing hypothesis: perhaps people coordinate smoothly in everyday interactions because they do not reason about beliefs at all. The coordination that takes place in ordinary circumstances may be belief-less coordination." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=13}{Guala 2020:161})
\par
"This research programme challenges a fundamental assumption of earlier theories of mindreading, namely, that we typically explain and predict behaviour by attributing 'full blown' beliefs and desires. Following the terminology of this volume, I will call it the 'minimal mind reading' (MMR) programme." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=14}{Guala 2020:162})
\par
"What is a 'full blown' belief or desire, to begin with? There is a core of characteristics that philosophers and psychologists typically associate with such mental states: a belief (desire) is (i) a propositional attitude, (ii) that causes behaviour; (iii) that is directly unobservable; and (iv) that is holistically related with other unobservable mental states. Propositional attitudes are mental states directed toward the content of propositions~- such as, for example, a desire that a certain event occurs ("John wants to have some cash in his pockets")." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=14}{Guala 2020:162})
\par
"According to an important strand of MMR theory, the main function of beliefdesire accounts is not to predict or explain behaviour. Belief-desire attributions play a totally different role: their main function is to justify behaviour, by attributing to agents a set of reasons for doing what they did." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=15}{Guala 2020:163})
\par
"A prominent~piece of evidence in favour of this hypothesis is that beliefs and desires are typically invoked in anomalous, problematic situations" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=15}{Guala 2020:163})
\par
"in routine situations, in contrast, attributions of 'full blown' beliefs are rare" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=15}{Guala 2020:163})
\par
"Generalizing, we may say that in normal circumstances beliefs tend to stay in the background. To anticipate people's behaviour, it is usually sufficient to monitor the environment and to assume that everyone will do what is appropriate in the circumstances. If explicit attributions of beliefs become necessary, then we often move from the tacit assumption that the other agents know more or less what we know." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=16}{Guala 2020:164})
\par
"The desire-belief asymmetry has a developmental aspect.20 Children seem to develop the capacity to attribute conative states (goals, intentions, desires) earlier than the capacity to attribute beliefs. This asymmetry may persist in adulthood in a different form~- as an augmented fluency and automaticity in desire-attribution than in belief-attribution" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=16}{Guala 2020:164})
\par
"In a number of papers, backed up by a large amount of experimental data, Gergely Csibra and Gyorgy Gergely have argued that pre-verbal infants interpret and predict others' behaviour by means of a strategy called teleological thinking" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=17}{Guala 2020:165})
\par
"Infants, in other words, predict behaviour using a simple efficiency principle: they assume that people will perform the most direct, least expensive action to achieve their goal. Since this interpretative strategy appears earlier than infants' capacity to form fullblown beliefs, Csibra and Gergely conclude that teleological thinking is a minimal technique that precedes and perhaps lays the foundations for full-blown mindreading." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ZLMNR5RU?page=17}{Guala 2020:165})
\par
"Csibra and Gergely draw a distinction between goals on the one hand, and desires or intentions on the other. While a desire is a cause (i.e. an antecedent condition) of behaviour, a goal is an outcome (i.e. a consequence) of behaviour. While a desire is a subjective state of the agent, a goal is an objective state of the world. Being a state of the world, a goal is more directly and easily represented than a desire (which is a state about a state, i.e. has propositional content). If they are right, then the efficiency principle may be employed in the context of an entirely non-mentalistic reasoning strategy, which exploits purely behavioural patterns and does not involve the attribution of any subjective mental state at all."

An idea? A theory? Each entails a different notion of social construction, Ian Hacking reminds us. His book explores an array of examples to reveal the deep issues underlying contentious accounts of reality.Especially troublesome in this dispute is the status of the natural sciences, and this is where Hacking finds some of his most telling cases, from the conflict between biological and social approaches to mental illness to vying accounts of current research in sedimentary geology. He looks at the issue of child abuse--very much a reality, though the idea of child abuse is a social product. He also cautiously examines the ways in which advanced research on new weapons influences not the content but the form of science. In conclusion, Hacking comments on the "culture wars" in anthropology, in particular a spat between leading ethnographers over Hawaii and Captain Cook. Written with generosity and gentle wit by one of our most distinguished philosophers of science, this wise book brings a much needed measure of clarity to current arguments about the nature of knowledge.},

  abstract = {Conversation between two people involves subtle nonverbal coordination in addition to speech. However, the precise parameters and timing of this coordination remain unclear, which limits our ability to theorize about the neural and cognitive mechanisms of social coordination. In particular, it is unclear if conversation is dominated by synchronization (with no time lag), rapid and reactive mimicry (with lags under 1~s) or traditionally observed mimicry (with several seconds lag), each of which demands a different neural mechanism. Here we describe data from high-resolution motion capture of the head movements of pairs of participants (n = 31 dyads) engaged in structured conversations. In a pre-registered analysis pathway, we calculated the wavelet coherence of head motion within dyads as a measure of their nonverbal coordination and report two novel results. First, low-frequency coherence (0.2–1.1~Hz) is consistent with traditional observations of mimicry, and modeling shows this behavior is generated by a mechanism with a constant 600~ms lag between leader and follower. This is in line with rapid reactive (rather than predictive or memory-driven) models of mimicry behavior, and could be implemented in mirror neuron systems. Second, we find an unexpected pattern of lower-than-chance coherence between participants, or hypo-coherence, at high frequencies (2.6–6.5~Hz). Exploratory analyses show that this systematic decoupling is driven by fast nodding from the listening member of the dyad, and may be a newly identified social signal. These results provide a step towards the quantification of real-world human behavior in high resolution and provide new insights into the mechanisms of social coordination. © 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Modern neuroimaging provides a common platform for neuroscience and related disciplines to explore the human brain, mind, and behavior. We base our review on the social shaping of the human mind and discuss various aspects of brain function related to social interaction. Despite private mental contents, people can share their understanding of the world using, beyond verbal communication, nonverbal cues such as gestures, facial expressions, and postures. The understanding of nonverbal messages is supported by the brain's mirroring systems that are shaped by individual experience. Within the organism-environment system, tight links exist between action and perception, both within an individual and between several individuals. Therefore, any comprehensive brain imaging study of the neuronal basis of social cognition requires appreciation of the situated and embodied nature of human cognition, motivating simultaneous monitoring of brain and bodily functions within a socially relevant environment. Because single-person studies alone cannot unravel the dynamic aspects of interpersonal interactions, it seems both necessary and beneficial to move towards “two-person neuroscience”; technological shortcomings and a limited conceptual framework have so far hampered such a leap. We conclude by discussing some major disorders of social interaction.},

  abstract = {The paper develops a new theory for the analysis of games with incomplete information where the players are uncertain about some important parameters of the game situation, such as the payoff functions, the strategies available to various players, the information other players have about the game, etc. However, each player has a subjective probability distribution over the alternative possibilities.             In most of the paper it is assumed that these probability distributions entertained by the different players are mutually “consistent”, in the sense that they can be regarded as conditional probability distributions derived from a certain “basic probability distribution” over the parameters unknown to the various players. But later the theory is extended also to cases where the different players' subjective probability distributions fail to satisfy this consistency assumption.             In cases where the consistency assumption holds, the original game can be replaced by a game where nature first conducts a lottery in accordance with the basic probability distribution, and the outcome of this lottery will decide which particular subgame will be played, i.e., what the actual values of the relevant parameters will be in the game. Yet, each player will receive only partial information about the outcome of the lottery, and about the values of these parameters. However, every player will know the “basic probability distribution” governing the lottery. Thus, technically, the resulting game will be a game with complete information. It is called the Bayes-equivalent of the original game. Part I of the paper describes the basic model and discusses various intuitive interpretations for the latter. Part II shows that the Nash equilibrium points of the Bayes-equivalent game yield “Bayesian equilibrium points” for the original game. Finally, Part III considers the main properties of the “basic probability distribution”.},

They propose rational criteria for selecting one particular uniformly perfect equilibrium point as the solution of any noncooperative game. And, because any cooperative game can be remodelled as a noncooperative bargaining game, their theory defines a one-point solution for any cooperative game as well. By providing solutions - based on the same principles of rational behavior - for all classes of games, both cooperative and noncooperative, both those with complete and with incomplete information, Harsanyi and Selten's approach achieves a remarkable degree of theoretical unification for game theory as a whole and provides a deeper insight into the nature of game-theoretic rationality. The book applies this theory to a number of specific game classes, such as unanimity games; bargaining with transaction costs; trade involving one seller and several buyers; two-person bargaining with incomplete information on one side, and on both sides. The last chapter discusses the relationship of the authors' theory to other recently proposed solution concepts, particularly the Kohberg-Mertens stability theory.},

Thankfully, through experience, we learn norms and conventions that provide stable expectations for navigating our social world. Here, we review several distinct influences on their content and distribution. At the level of individuals locally interacting in dyads, success depends on rapidly adapting pre-existing norms to the local context. Hence, norms are shaped by complex cognitive processes involved in learning and social reasoning. At the population level, norms are influenced by intergenerational transmission and the structure of the social network. As human social connectivity continues to increase, understanding and predicting how these levels and time scales interact to produce new norms will be crucial for improving communities.},

Yet language use in a variable and non-stationary social environment requires linguistic representations to be flexible: old words acquire new ad hoc or partner-specific meanings on the fly. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Continual Hierarchical Adaptation through Inference), a hierarchical Bayesian theory of coordination and convention formation that aims to reconcile the long-standing tension between these two basic observations. We argue that the central computational problem of communication is not simply transmission, as in classical formulations, but continual learning and adaptation over multiple timescales. Partner-specific common ground quickly emerges from social inferences within dyadic interactions, while community-wide social conventions are stable priors that have been abstracted away from interactions with multiple partners. We present new empirical data alongside simulations showing how our model provides a computational foundation for several phenomena that have posed a challenge for previous accounts: (1) the convergence to more efficient referring expressions across repeated interaction with the same partner, (2) the gradual transfer of partner-specific common ground to strangers, and (3) the influence of communicative context on which conventions eventually form.},

"Some dedicated naturalisers may be tempted by a radical eliminativism about the social. If we combine fundamental physics with a philosophical assertion of radical reductionism, then we may be able to deduce that there is really no such thing as a social group, the Labour Party, a marriage, or a race. But physics alone won't do it, in the absence of a philosophical 'that's all, folks' claim: the eliminativist naturaliser must find an acceptable philosophical method which will enable her to reason to such a position." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBKBSNVY?page=2}{Hawley 2018:188})
\par
"If this seems too daunting, we may pursue an alternative approach to naturalising social metaphysics. If we conceive of the naturaliser as someone who is not myopically dedicated to fundamental physics, but is rather an admirer of scientific methods or empirical study more generally, we would expect her to look to the social sciences to provide us with a metaphysics for the social world. Just as the natural sciences provide us with epistemic access to the non-social elements of reality, the naturaliser may argue that our best chance of learning about the entities and relationships which constitute social reality is to investigate the social sciences." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBKBSNVY?page=3}{Hawley 2018:189})
\par
"Naturalising metaphysicians cannot draw their metaphysical conclusions from just any old scientific theory, but only from those which meet a very high epistemic standard. Given these restrictions, the pessimistic induction has fewer instances to work with: without detailed investigation of the history of science it is not obvious that there really are many examples of successful, mature, novelly-predictive scientific theories which have turned out to be metaphysically misguided in some central way." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WBKBSNVY?page=4}{Hawley 2018:190})
\par
"Second, it is far from obvious that social scientific theories are well placed to generate successful novel predictions. According to scientific realists in the context of the natural sciences, we should infer ontological claims only from those theories which have generated such predictions; merely accommodating already-familiar data is not good enough (Psillos 1999). This is because, crudely speaking, it seems just too easy to gerrymander a 'theory' to accommodate our existing observations, and so the fact that a theory can account for known data does not reflect positively on its likely accuracy about the unobserved. In contrast, the ability of a theory to make a novel yet accurate prediction—and the more surprising the better—is thought to indicate its proximity to the truth."

  abstract = {Although rational choice theory has made considerable advances in other social sciences, its progress in sociology has been limited. Some sociologists' reservations about rational choice arise from a misunderstanding of the theory. The first part of this essay therefore introduces rational choice as a general theoretical perspective, or family of theories, which explains social outcomes by constructing models of individual action and social context. “Thin” models of individual action are mute about actors' motivations, while “thick” models specify them ex ante. Other sociologists' reservations, however, stem from doubts about the empirical adequacy of rational choice explanations. To this end, the bulk of the essay reviews a sample of recent studies that provide empirical support for particular rational choice explanations in a broad spectrum of substantive areas in sociology. Particular attention is paid to studies on the family, gender, and religion, for these subareas often are considered least amenable to understanding in terms of rational choice logic.}

I argue that the Beliefs-Rules-Equilibrium account of institutions can contribute to advancing the debate on an issue of particular importance, regarding the specific form of dependence characterizing the relation between institutions and individuals’ attitudes about them. I tackle this issue by taking Francesco Guala's claims about the nature of institutions made in his book “Understanding Institutions” as a point of departure. In particular, I reject Guala’s functionalism about institutions. On the basis of the Beliefs-Rules-Equilibrium account, I claim that it is futile to search for constitutive features of general institutions (money, property rights, family…) and that the best we can have is a knowledge of what are the rules within a specific institution, which the agents consider to be essential in their institutional practice.},

«Though perhaps schematic, two broad perspectives on the relationship between social ontology and social sciences can be distinguished on the basis of recent studies in this field. From a ‘foundationalist’ perspective, social ontology is viewed as providing the metaphysical foundations on the basis of which sound scientific modeling and theorizing can be developed within the social sciences. Such a perspective is notably explicitly argued for by philosophers like John Searle (2010), Raimo Tuomela (2013) or Brian Epstein (2015). The foundationalist view clearly gives social ontology a conceptual priority, in the sense that an appropriate scientific understanding of the social world cannot be attained without first ‘getting the ontology right’. On the other hand, the ‘naturalist’ perspective follows the broader lead of naturalism in philosophy, by postulating that ontological knowledge and scientific knowledge are essentially of the same kind and can be produced along essentially similar methods. This view has notably been recently endorsed by economists and philosophers of economics, e.g. Guala (2016) or Smit et al. (2011). The naturalist perspective considers that social sciences determine the appropriate constraints that must be imposed to any relevant social ontology and discards the existence of social ontology as an independent field, arguing for ‘foundationless social sciences’ (Sugden 2016).» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 74)
\par
«I reject Guala’s functionalism about institutions. On the basis of the Beliefs-Rules-Equilibrium account, I claim that it is futile to search for constitutive features of general institutions (money, property rights, family...) and that the best we can have is a knowledge of what are the rules within a specific institution that the agents consider to be essential in their institutional practice.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 74)
\par
«It is not possible to cite the whole body of relevant literature here. Schelling (1981) and Sugden (2005) figure as two of the earliest and most significant game-theoretic accounts of institutions. Greif (2006) presents several methodologically related historical studies of particular economic institutions that build on a game-theoretic framework. Basu (2018) develops, what he refers to as, the ‘focal point approach’ within the economic analysis of law. This approach applies the more general game-theoretic account of institutions to law and economics, as sketched notably by Hurwicz (1996, 2008) and Myerson (2009). Other major significant contributions are by Bicchieri (2006), Binmore (1998), Schelling (1981) and Skyrms (1996).» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 75)
\par
«The label BRE provides an indication: institutions (partially) determine agents’ behavior on the basis of rules through which agents form beliefs about the social world (including the behavior of others); these beliefs in turn, combined with the agents’ preferences over outcomes, are incentivizing agents to behave in such a way that – providing their beliefs are approximately correct – no one wishes to change her behavior, i.e. the resulting strategy profile is a game-theoretic equilibrium. This formulation is an open one in the sense that it does not prescribe a specific way to model social institutions. In particular, it does not indicate which equilibrium concept is the relevant one. It is a feature that makes the BRE account a generalization of recent naturalistic social ontologies. This is in particular the most important difference with Guala’s (2016) and Hindriks and Guala’s (2015) ‘rules-inequilibrium’ account, which makes use of the correlated equilibrium solution concept. The substantive implication is that institutions are defined as correlation devices (see also Gintis 2009). In some cases, this may be unnecessarily restrictive, for instance when a rule fails to prescribe a definite behavior. Leaving of the issue of the relevant solution concept opened makes the BRE account more general, since it applies to a larger class of games, including dynamic games formalizing sequential interactions.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 77)
\par
«the institution defines, what can be called, a social game in which the set of socially permissible strategies is a strict subset of the physically possible ones, with the set of possible outcomes correspondingly reduced.5 Depending on the criterion used to demarcate socially permissible strategies from socially forbidden ones, it is of course possible that several social games may be figured out by different players in the very same circumstances.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 78)
\par
«the rules constituting an institution may sometimes work in a hierarchically-ordered way. In the simplest case, there may be primary (or firstorder) rules socially forbidding some strategic play and secondary (or second-order) rules specifying – given the social game actually played – which strategic outcome should be implemented. If the primary rules socially forbid all but one strategy for each player, then of course there is no need for secondary rules. In a more complex case, primary rules may indicate how to determine the relevant social game to be played in specific circumstances. Secondary rules will then specify the socially impermissible strategic plays, while ternary rules will eventually indicate which outcome should be implemented, again given the social game actually played. In principle, an infinite hierarchy of such ordered rules may exist, but it is more relevant, both conceptually and practically, to assume that such a hierarchy must be finite.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 78)
\par
«some rules may be regarded as more essential or fundamental than others in determining the nature of an institution.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 79)
\par
«Schelling’s (1981) concept of focal points captures the relationship between rules and beliefs: a rule determines what an agent sees as ‘self-evident’ or ‘the most likely’, because it consists in a shared understanding of a given social interaction. The existence of focal points itself depends on shared inductive standards and reasoning modes (Hédoin 2014; Lewis 2002; Sugden 2011). In this sense, rules and beliefs are not causally related (e.g. a rule causally determines one’s beliefs), but are rather constitutively related: the existence of a» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 79)
\par
«rule consists in the fact that an outcome is identified as a focal point or a social game is identified as a ‘focal curb’.8 As noted by Basu (2018), this is a key insight for understanding how law can change people’s behavior: a law never creates new strategies de novo or directly alters outcomes in the game of life. A law-induced change in behavior is always due to a successful change in people’s beliefs, either in the game of life or in a social game.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 80)
\par
«Institutions are therefore viewed as hierarchical sets of rules indicating what is socially permissible (the social game defined as a focal curb) and eventually what is socially expected (the focal point within the social game). These rules are themselves related to a nexus of beliefs and choices: to claim that a game is rulegoverned implies that the players share some inductive standards and reasoning modes, such that in a given ‘game situation’ all players share convergent expectations about what others are believing and doing, i.e. that a focal point exists. The very existence of an institution (or of an ‘institutional kind’) thus entails, on the BRE account that: (1) Agents share inductive standards and reasoning modes, what corresponds to the existence of focal points. (2) Agents hold correct beliefs about others’ beliefs and choices, as implied by the preceding point. (3) The choices form a game-theoretic equilibrium, such that everyone is incentivized in acting as they do.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 80)
\par
«the existence of rules is deeply intertwined with the cognitive possibility of conditional reasoning and thus with the ability of agents to form conditional beliefs (Hédoin 2019).» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 80)
\par
«In particular, the functioning of institutions is partially determined by the players’ counterfactual beliefs over null events, i.e. events to which they ascribe a zero probability.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 81)
\par
«Cultural beliefs are “the shared ideas and thoughts that govern interactions among individuals and between them, their gods, and other groups”. They “differ from knowledge in that they are not empirically discovered or analytically proved”. Finally, they “become identical and commonly known through the socialization process, by which culture is unified, maintained, and communicated” (Greif 2006: 269–70).» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 81)
\par
«Cultural beliefs are directly responsible for the equilibrium selection in a game, because they provide focal points and help the coordination of expectations. They are self-enforcing, since at the equilibrium the players’ beliefs are correct, i.e. they match with the actual behavioral pattern corresponding to the institutional practice. Greif explicitly characterizes selfenforcing cultural beliefs as “a set of probability distributions over an equilibrium strategy combination”. In particular, each probability distribution “reflects the expectation of a player with respect to the actions that will be taken on and off the path of play” (Greif 2006: 270–1, my emphasis). In other words, cultural beliefs extend over events, which cannot occur under the rule-governed practice. Greif’s study shows that these off-the-path-of-play beliefs are nonetheless decisive because they directly determine, within the related game-theoretic model, the threshold values of parameters or variables (in this case, wage level),» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 81) Conditional reasoning, that makes possible change in beliefs, affects equilibrium selection and hence promotes a different rule. This specifies Guala's [-@guala2016b] notion of representation as a key differentiator between "animal conventions" and human social institutions.
\par
«Hence, a change in these beliefs would entail a change in the equilibrium and thus a different rule.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 82)
\par
«Rawls argues that another distinction should be made, this time between the two concepts of rules: the summary view and the practice conception. The former conceives rules in terms of statistical summaries of past behaviors resulting from the application of some normative principle of decision-making (e.g. the utilitarian principle). The latter views rules as being logically prior to any instantiation of a practice. Rather than summarizing past behavior, rules create the conditions for making some actions logically possible.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 83) [[Searle's distinction of regulative and constitutive rules mirrors Rawls's (1955) distinction of summary and practice rules]]
\par
«taking the internal point of view with respect to a rule or a set of rules means that one commits (at least counterfactually) to the corresponding practice and – under this assumption – reflects on the reasons and justifications for following the rule(s), i.e. for behaving in a certain way in the context of an institutionalized practice.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 84)
\par
«In developing their rules-in-equilibrium account, Hindriks and Guala (2015) make a distinction between what they call ‘observer-rules’ and ‘agent-rules’. This roughly corresponds to Rawls’s two concepts of rules: observer-rules are formulated to summarize agents’ behavior, while agent-rules by agents themselves to summarize and to guide her own behavior. However, this terminology may be regarded as slightly misleading, because it seems to indicate that an observer» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 84)

But, in the same way that I can infer someone else’s intentional attitudes without being ‘in her mind’, I as an external observer can also adopt the internal point of view of rules to elucidate the reasons underlying the rule-following behaviors. The crux is thus not whether one is an observer or they take part in a practice, but rather on the underlying conception of rules that one adopts. If Rawls’s distinction between the justification of a practice and the justification of an action falling into a practice is considered as relevant, then the practice conception of rules seems to be the only interesting one, as it is also the only one to consider the internal point of view.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 85)
\par
«Hédoin (2017) identifies institutions to ‘rules-governed games’ satisfying conditions of symmetric reasoning and minimal awareness. Though the details are not relevant here, what matters is that the internal point of view of rules is naturally taken once one adopts an epistemic game-theoretic framework, because it is then that beliefs and reasoning modes have to be explicitly formalized.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 86)
\par
«In particular, reasoning about counterfactuals may give prudential reasons to act in some way. Counterfactuals may appear to be less relevant for deontic reasoning – especially if the reasoning takes the form of categorical, rather than hypothetical imperatives. But counterfactual reasoning may be needed to reflect over what Gaus (2019) calls the ‘eligible moral space’–the space of morally permissible acts within a rule system.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 86)
\par
«In a recent paper, Gaus and Nichols (2017) distinguish between two types of rule systems: permissive and prohibitory. The former instructs agents what they are allowed to do, while the latter only specifies what agents are prohibited from doing. Both systems allow for a great diversity of acts, though permissive systems are more restrictive than prohibitory systems. This implies that an agent contemplating to behave in a certain way, which is not explicitly prohibited or permitted by the current rules, should conditionally reason about the deontic status of the corresponding act. But even an agent intending to follow rules may have to reason over counterfactual possibilities of behaving otherwise, in order to justify her behavior to others.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 86)
\par
«I therefore argue that the BRE account of institutions allows to capture an important characteristic that distinguishes social kinds from natural kinds. There is more than that however: the BRE account points to the importance of the internal point of view to study institutions. Though other recent naturalistic social ontologies also underline a similar distinction between two perspectives or points of» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 86)

\par
«A key issue in social ontology concerns the existence and the nature of social kinds. A contemporary definition of kinds is that of homeostatic property clusters (Boyd 1991), i.e. packages of highly correlated properties, the correlation of which is relatively stable and results from some causal mechanisms.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 87)
\par
«A key property of real kinds is that they are projectable, in the sense that they support inductive inferences and generalizations (Guala 2016).» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 87)
\par
«Within real kinds, several philosophers and social scientists have argued further for a distinction between natural and social kinds on the basis of different criteria. Hacking (2000), for instance, suggests that what makes social kinds special, relatively to natural kinds, is that the former but not the latter are ‘interactive’ or ‘reflexive’.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 87)
\par
«This peculiar relationship between social kinds and individuals’ attitudes about them is sometimes referred to as a relation of ‘constitutive dependence’. On this account, an entity X belongs to a kind K if and only if the members of the relevant population hold the appropriate mental states that X belongs to K.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 87)
\par
«In many influential social ontologies, like Searle’s (1997), the appropriate mental states are related to a form of collective acceptance which can be abbreviated in the following way: Constitutive Dependence: For all X, X is K if and only if there is a set of conditions C such that (a) there is collective acceptance CA that X is K if C, and (b) C holds.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 87)
\par
«Let call the ‘dependence thesis’, the view that social kinds are characterized by such a relationship between a kind and individuals’ attitudes about it. Guala (2016) argues against the dependence thesis on the basis of his rules-in-equilibrium account of institutions combined with a functionalism about institutions.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 87)
\par
«Guala’s (2016) rejection of the dependence thesis is grounded in the claim that each particular institutional practice is based on a set of rules, which can be characterized independently of people’s classifications. Guala also claims that we can identify general forms of institutions on the basis of their functions. Guala argues that these functions cannot be discovered by merely participating in a social practice. Establishing the functions of an institution requires empirical knowledge that can only be obtained through scientificmethods. Guala’s functionalism about institutions, if it succeeded, would entail the rejection of the dependence thesis because then it would be possible to determine the nature of an institution by identifying its objective (i.e. mindindependent) functions and thus to assess the truth value of people’sbeliefs about them. However, in this section, I want to argue that Guala’s functionalism hides the fact that there is at least another key attribute separating social kinds from natural kinds, i.e. the fact that the former are inherently normative.Bythis, Imeanthatsocialkindscanbeascribed to a particular normative status by individuals who directly take partinthem.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 88) {$>$} Maybe, Guala does not reject the dependence thesis, as representation of o-rules by a-rules may not have a truth function.

{$>$} As institutions are norm-governed practices, they are still dependent on normative expectations of agents as they condition their behavior upon them. So, if these expectations change, the equilibrium might change, as well. However, this neither endorses nor refutes functionalism about institutions, for a-rules governing conduct are representations of o-rules, or strategies, and relations between beliefs in practice and what institution really does may not have truth function.
\par
«Arguably, insisting that token-institutions determine the content and nature of type-institutions would condemn one to some form of traditionalism forbidding the evolution of any institution (think of same-sex marriage). Moreover, on the BRE account, there is indeed a sense according to which a type-institution could be identified to a ‘class of (social) games’ and thus solving a kind of coordination problems. The problem with this argument is that while it may be true that the way people represent a type-institution T at a given time and location through a token-institution Ti cannot define what T is, it remains to determine how the functions of T are to be established. Another way to state the problem is the following: while one (especially the social scientist) may legitimately identify T with a class of games it solves, thus determining its functions, it is not clear why we could not identify T with another (not necessarily mutually exclusive) class of games. Functionalism supposes that we can identify the functions of an 12 Externalism about meaning holds as long as we agree with Guala that constitutive dependence is not a characteristic of social kinds. Then, the extension of any linguistic expression designating an institution is fully determined by what individuals are doing, i.e. the equilibrium or set of equilibria in the BRE account. This is not in contradiction with the claim that what individuals are doing depends on their attitudes, including their normative attitudes about their practice. The Beliefs-Rules-Equilibrium Account of Institutions 8» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 89)

«institution, but this very identification may well be grounded in collective representations and acceptance.13» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 90) {$>$} If representation of type-institution with token-institution by agents cannot establish the identity of the former, it is unclear how functions are established.

{$>$} However, another way to save functionalism is to account for "behavioral regularity" part of institutions as conventions are "function-stabilizing mechanisms" [@harms2004].
\par
«What can be asserted, however, is that this normative force is mind-dependent. This normative (or value) dependence of institutions upon individuals’ attitudes is related to the two forms of justifications underlined by Rawls (1955),» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 91)
\par
«What characterizes an ‘essential’ rule then is the fact that the whole institutional practice would lose most of its value (from the perspective of the participants themselves) were the rule not to be followed.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 92)
\par
«Marmor (2009: 39) makes a very similar point: “engaging in the practice constituted by [the rule] S is valuable (at least for those who engage in it) in ways in which it could not have been valuable without the existence of S”.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 92)
\par
«I have no qualm about characterizing the normative or value dependence of institutions in terms of (teleological) function. However, in their aforementioned paper, Hindriks and Guala retain the type/token distinction that I have claimed should be rejected. Moreover, they assert that an adequate theory of institutions should not be ‘moralized’, i.e. institutions should not be defined in terms of the values they (are supposed to) promote.17 If we were to accept the type/token distinction, this should probably be true for type-institutions. But the above analysis suggests that the concept of type-institution is problematic. And as my discussion of essential rules indicates, a full characterization of token-institutions actually requires the ‘moralization’ Hindriks and Guala are rejecting.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 93)
\par
«Any theory of institutions, and the scientific image of social kinds more generally, is bounded by this value dependence. A naturalist (rather than a ‘scientist’) social ontology should give scope, in its endeavor to characterize the nature of particular institutions, to the role played by values endorsed by persons and that ground the particular normative importance given to some rules.» (Hédoin, 2021, p. 95) {$>$} Institutions are value-dependent. However, how norm-governance and value-dependence are related?},

What accounts for our capacity to understand the way the physical world works, to think ourselves into the minds of others, to gossip, read, tell stories about the past, and imagine the future? These questions are not new: they have been debated by philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists, evolutionists, and neurobiologists over the course of centuries. One explanation widely accepted today is that humans have special cognitive instincts. Unlike other living animal species, we are born with complicated mechanisms for reasoning about causation, reading the minds of others, copying behaviors, and using language. Cecilia Heyes agrees that adult humans have impressive pieces of cognitive equipment. In her framing, however, these cognitive gadgets are not instincts programmed in the genes but are constructed in the course of childhood through social interaction. Cognitive gadgets are products of cultural evolution, rather than genetic evolution. At birth, the minds of human babies are only subtly different from the minds of newborn chimpanzees. We are friendlier, our attention is drawn to different things, and we have a capacity to learn and remember that outstrips the abilities of newborn chimpanzees. Yet when these subtle differences are exposed to culture-soaked human environments, they have enormous effects. They enable us to upload distinctively human ways of thinking from the social world around us. As Cognitive Gadgets makes clear, from birth our malleable human minds can learn through culture not only what to think but how to think it.--},

This puzzle relates to the location of certain social entities. Where, for instance, are organizations located? Where their members are, or where their designated offices are? Organizations depend on their members for their existence, but the members of an organization can be where the organization is not. The designated office of an organization, however, need be little more than a mailbox. I argue that the problem can be solved by conceptualizing the relation between social entities and non-social entities as one of constitution, a relation of unity without identity. Constituted objects have properties that cannot be reduced to properties of the constituting objects. Thus, my attempt to solve the Location Problem results in an argument in favor of a kind of non-reductive materialism about the social.},

"According to the rule-based conception, institutions are behavioural rules that guide and constrain behaviour during social interaction, while according to the equilibrium-based conception institutions are equilibria of strategic games.

"The most popular and widely cited characterization of social institutions can be found in the opening paragraphs of Douglass North's monograph on Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance: Institutions are the rules of the game of society or, more formally, the humanly devised constraints that shape human interactions. [ . . . ] Institutions reduce uncertainty by providing a structure to everyday life. They are a guide to human interaction, so that when we wish to greet friends on the street, drive an automobile, buy oranges, borrow money, form a business, bury our dead, or whatever, we know (or can learn easily) how to perform these tasks. (1990: 3-4) Like many other scholars, North does not say explicitly whether he is giving a definition, an empirical description, or whether he is introducing an idealized theoretical concept for the study of institutions."

"Theories within the equilibria approach view institutions as behavioural patterns or regularities. For example, Andy Schotter - a prominent game theorist and experimental economist - defines institutions as 'regularities in behaviour which are agreed to by all members of a society' (1981: 9). Such regularities 'can be best described as non-cooperative equilibria' of strategic games (1981: 24), because out-of-equilibrium actions are unstable and are unlikely to be repeated in the course of many interactions."

"The property game is a problem of coordination with asymmetric equilibria, depending on who is going to give way. But since the players are perfectly identical, why should one of them accept a lower payoff? Notice that the only symmetric solutions here are not only inefficient, but are not even equilibria of the game. As a consequence we should expect some player to deviate unilaterally sooner or later." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=6}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:464})
\par
"An obvious solution in such circumstances is to adopt a correlation device. A correlation device is a signalling mechanism that the players can use to coordinate their actions. Think of a traffic light, for example, indicating by means of different colours (red/green) who has the right to cross a busy road at each particular moment. In general, correlation devices need not be artificial tools built for a specific purpose. Any external mechanism may do, provided it sends reliable and correlated signals to the players. In the case of property, for example, the players may rely on a simple pre-emption device: whoever occupied the land first has the right to use it. The temporal order of occupation, or the sequence of the claims made by the players, is used as correlation device. Except in rare cases, this device provides unambiguous, correlated signals to the players." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=7}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:465})
\par
"No agent is served better by acting differently, on the assumption that the others follow the signal, which implies that the set of actions is a correlated equilibrium" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=7}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:465})
\par
"This is similar to the solution of other problems analysed by Lewis (1969), such as the driving game that we have mentioned earlier. In that case, the drivers condition their choices on the history of play. The only difference is that in the driving game the conditional strategy does not lead to a substantially different outcome than any of the two unconditional strategies ('keep right', 'keep left'). In the property game in contrast it creates a new behavioural pattern, for none of the unconditional strategies can deliver symmetric payoffs. This capacity - the capacity to create new outcomes - is an important feature of many institutions, as we shall see shortly." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=7}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:465})
\par
"The pair of strategies (D, D) is an equilibrium, but intuitively it is not an institution. Why? The reason is that each agent can implement the rule independently. There is no need to coordinate strategies. In fact there is no reason to even think about the action of the other player: whatever she does, it is optimal to defect. That's why mutual defection in this game is often taken to represent the proto-typical failure of sociality." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=8}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:466})
\par
"In order to achieve a satisfactory definition of institutions, however, we must introduce a third condition: representation, to capture the idea that the players must be able to represent the equilibrium in symbolic form. As we discuss in Section 5, this can be facilitated by so-called constitutive rules that have special symbolic significance. The reason why this third condition of representation is needed is that the notion of correlated equilibrium is far too permissive and would let in too many behavioural patterns that we would not intuitively consider institutions."

"Non-human animals solve coordination games using correlation devices, but animals do not have institutions. Since there are in nature a few examples of anti-bourgeois equilibria, the expression 'animal convention' seems to be more appropriate. Whichever equilibrium has been selected, however, the important point is that the strategies are biologically implemented or - in a broad sense of the term - genetically encoded in each species. A group of butterflies cannot coordinate on anything but who occupied the sunspot first. They can play this particular strategy only. They cannot invent a new equilibrium. Humans, in contrast, can: they hook onto different correlations, invent constantly new strategies, and dramatically enlarge the number of possible equilibria." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=9}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:467})
\par
"What distinguishes human institutions from the correlated equilibria of Pararge aegeria? The answer seems to be that butterflies react only to a narrow set of signals, such as who enters the spotlight first. A simple mechanism that links one type of stimulus with one type of behaviour guarantees coordination. More complex creatures in contrast are able to decouple stimulus and behaviour. They do so by adding an intermediate state - a representation of the environment - that they use to condition their behaviour (Sterelny, 2003). Moreover, such complex creatures can condition their strategies on many different representations - many signals and many correlation devices. In the case of humans, we say that they can follow different rules. These rules are representations in symbolic form of the strategies that ought to be followed in a given game."

"10 Knight (1992: 69) makes a similar distinction between 'regularities' and 'rules', where the former are said to be essentially backward-looking and the latter forward-looking. Ostrom (1990: 51) and Hodgson (2006) also emphasize the guiding role of institutions, and offer analyses that are in many ways compatible with our 'rules-in-equilibrium' account. For a seminal discussion of different kinds of rules, see Rawls (1955)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=10}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:468})
\par
"Each player, therefore, will perceive the institution as a prescription to use the land if the circumstances are 'right'. Since the two strategies are formulated as rules, clearly the equilibrium is a set of rules - one for each player - that, as North puts it, 'establish a stable structure to human interaction' (1990: 6)."

"Unlike in 'pure' rules-based theories, the concept of equilibrium is central in this account. But unlike 'pure' equilibrium-based theories, this account brings at centre stage the representation of the equilibrium strategies by means of symbolic markers (rules). Aoki (2001, 2007) in particular has emphasized that symbolic markers summarize the properties of equilibria. Institutions help individual players not only to reach coordination, but also to economize cognitive effort." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=11}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:469})

"We have shown that existing theories fail to do justice to the role of either coordination, or correlation, or representation.

"However, explanatory power is not only a matter of convenience. It also serves to reveal that apparent diversity can be traded for an appreciation of the actual unity of the social world (M ̈aki 2001: 502-03). This can be done by increasing explanatory depth or explanatory integration (Ylikoski and Kuorikoski 2012). Providing a mechanism, as we have done when discussing correlation, increases explanatory depth. The unified theory can answer more questions than the two original approaches could do even in combination. As a consequence, it provides a higher degree of understanding of the nature of institutions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=11}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:469})
\par
\emph{[[@hindriks2015|Hindriks and Guala (2015)]] note that providing a mechanism of correlation increases explanatory depth of a unified theory of social institutions. 

A more unified theory would be not only explaining how institutions structure agents' behaviour, but also explaining what cognitive and evolutionary mechanisms enable them to do so. 

For example, discussing social cognition, [[@caporael2007|Caporael (2007)]] says that coordination is different at distinct scales. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=11}{note on p.469})}

"Searle contrasts constitutive rules to regulative rules that have as their syntax 'do X', or 'if Y, do X'. Since the actions or strategies that appear in game-theoretic accounts of institutions have precisely this form, regulative rules play a key role in the rules-in-equilibrium approach. So Searle's distinction is meant to suggest that there is a deep hiatus between his approach and the accounts of institutions found in the social science literature." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=12}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:470})
\par
"A central claim of the constitutive rules approach is that institutions exist only because we believe they exist. Our beliefs are thought to play a constitutive role with respect to institutional actions. The constitutive view, however, is not restricted to actions. In addition to actions, institutions often involve objects (like money, university buildings), persons (police officers, presidents), and events (declarations of war, graduations). The constitutive view applies to items from all of these ontological categories. In the case of money, for example, a constitutive rule is: 'Bills issued by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (X) count as money (Y) in the United States (C)' (1995: 28).12 The schematic letter X can be replaced by predicates that apply either to actions or to items from several other ontological categories."

"base rules concern the ontological basis or constitution base of statuses. Status rules, in contrast, are meaning rules and concern the definition of status terms. They concern the behaviour that the status regulates, or the rights and obligations that the status entails." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=13}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:471})
\par
"iece of land is someone's property∗, she has the right to its exclusive use. Another way to put it is that we have transformed the regulative rule [R] in two rules, [B] and [S], respectively: [B] If a person first occupies a piece of land, then it is her property∗. [S] If a piece of land is someone's property∗, she has the right to use it. Now, the combination of these two rules forms a constitutive rule: [C] If a person first occupies a piece of land then it is her property∗, and if a piece of land is someone's property∗ then she has the right to use it. The [C] rule has the typical structure of Searle's 'X counts as Y in C' formula, provided that (a) the expression 'counts as' is interpreted in terms of conditions of acceptance, as proposed earlier; (b) the Y term is unpacked so as to make the content of the status function explicit by means of the status rule. A constitutive rule, once these two points have been made explicit, has the following structure: 'If C then X is Y, and if Y then Z', where 'if Y then Z' is a status rule that specifies the actions that are made available to the relevant individuals. The view that regulative rules can be transformed into constitutive rules using this XYZ schema and via the introduction of terms such as 'property∗' is what we call (following Hindriks 2005, 2009) the transformation view of constitutive rules." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=14}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:472})
\par
"Thus, in line with the rulesin-equilibrium approach, the representation of the equilibrium in symbolic form has the advantage of cognitive economy, especially in those cases where several rules are used to govern interrelated strategic interactions. But apart from this, no big changes are implied as far as the original rule is concerned. In particular, behaviour in accordance to the original rule [R] is extensionally equivalent to behaviour in accordance to the content of the rules [B] and [S] that employ the term 'property∗'." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=15}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:473})
\par
"Constitutive rules are linguistic transformations of regulative rules. Such transformations rely on the introduction of a new term that is used to name an institution. In the end, constitutive rules are nothing but (systems of) regulative rules augmented by the introduction of theoretical terms." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=15}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:473})
\par
"The introduction of new terms may change the meaning of the original terms that survive the transformation, and as a consequence the post-transformation theory may be inconsistent with the pre-transformation theory.15 So, we need to find transformation criteria that guarantee consistency. Belnap's (1993) criteria for rigorous definitions can play this role. Belnap argues that, in order for a definition to be rigorous, it should satisfy the criteria of eliminability and conservativeness. The criterion of eliminability requires 'that the defined term be eliminable in favour of previously understood terms', and the criterion of conservativeness demands 'that the definition not only not lead to inconsistency, but not lead to anything - not involving the defined term - that was not obtainable before' (Belnap 1993: 117)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=15}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:473})
\par
"constitutive rules are regulative rules with special features. In particular, they are regulative rules that have been split in two parts using Y-terms to turn the parts into complete sentences. And the definitions of Y-terms are rigorous in Belnap's sense: they do not lead to anything that could not be obtained before. Before the introduction of the relevant Y-term the link between the two parts was internal to the regulative rule. After its introduction, the link is forged by the fact that the Y-term figures both in the base rule and in the status rule. This implies that definitions of Y-terms are conservative in Belnap's sense." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=16}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:474})
\par
"An important reason for taking the transformations of regulative rules seriously is that we do in fact employ many Y-terms. 'Money' and 'marriage' as well as 'president', 'property', and 'promise' are prominent examples. The version of the constitutive view under discussion helps us to appreciate the meaning of these terms and analyse the way they are used in particular contexts. By investigating such terms using the XYZ-schema we can do justice to the linguistic framework with which ordinary people operate in their everyday lives. Another way to put it is that the transformation view builds a bridge between the ontology implicit in ordinary language and the ontology of social science. And the constitutive rules account plays an important role in this process of unification, by outlining the fundamental grammatical form of the ordinary sentences that contain institutional terms."

"A multiply realizable property is a property that can occur in different guises depending on the context. Money, for example, can come in the form of shells or coins.

\par
"Think for example of different items that are used as money in various contexts and of different procedures one has to go through in order to get married in various countries. Thus, unification of the constitutive view and the rules-in-equilibrium account allows seeing that in the case of institutions the ontological phenomenon of multiple realizability is intimately related to the theoretical phenomenon of multiple equilibria. At least in many cases, they come down to the same thing." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J8T99B4H?page=18}{Hindriks and Guala 2015:476})

"David Lewis' views on ontology and scientific realism are congenial to most of what has been said thus far. Lewis would agree that institutions such as money, property, and driving on the right are real phenomena. As a pioneer of the equilibrium approach, he would agree that accepting regulative rules (strategies) suffices for their existence. In addition to this, however, he would also accept that such institutions could be adequately described in terms of constitutive rules. Lewis' work on theoretical terms offers the conceptual resources for this claim: a set of constitutive rules that pertain to a set of interlocking institutions can be regarded as a theory of sorts. If the constitutive rule for property∗ is part of the set, then 'property∗' is a theoretical term. According to Lewis, 'If [a theoretical term] purports to name something, then if the theory that introduced it is true it does name something' (1983: 79)."

"Binmore argues that a Nash equilibrium is more apt to appear in a theory of institutions than correlated equilibrium because in a Nash equilibrium the correlation device is explicitly stated, not 'hidden from view'. We fully agree on the importance of correlation devices. The reason why we chose an exposition based on correlated equilibrium is that it highlights another important feature of institutions: the fact that coordination problems can usually be solved in different ways. There are many potential correlation devices, and although there are human universals - as Vernon Smith reminds us - there are also differences in the ways in which the same problem of coordination is addressed in different societies. Although we agree with Binmore that the unified theory could be expressed in terms of Nash equilibria, we chose this theoretical framework to highlight the variety of coordination devices."

Simpler cognition will usually do. Sugden makes these claims to criticize our approach, but the critique is based on a misunderstanding: we do not think that common knowledge is needed and we tried to be as non-committal as possible regarding collective intentionality, to avoid to get muddled in this controversial topic."

We agree, but contrary to what he suggests we are not committed to 'human exceptionalism' a priori. Perhaps the fact that ordinarily we do not speak of animal institutions is an accident that science will correct. But it is also possible that ordinary language reflects a significant difference between the causal mechanisms that govern human and animal societies. If so, it might make sense to talk of social practices among animals, but not of social institutions. This is another working hypothesis that we would like to put to the test."

"Some philosophers believe that normativity can be explained in terms of mutual beliefs and the feeling of resentment that we experience when our expectations are frustrated (Bicchieri, 2006; Lewis, 1969; Sugden, 1998); others believe that normativity requires a stronger notion of collective or joint intention (Gilbert, 1989); some philosophers and social scientists argue that normativity depends on emotions (Frank, 1987; Gibbard, 1990; Nichols, 2004); and still others believe that normativity has to do with the possibility of justifying our actions by means of rational arguments (Broome, 2013; Raz, 1999; Skorupsky, 2010). Whether any of these accounts is able to explain normativity in a satisfactory way is an open question that we do not want to settle here.

«Social norms can affect behaviors because of sanctions people might incur for violating them. According to equilibrium theories, sanctions change people’s preferences in cooperation games such that they cooperate (UllmannMargalit 1977; Schotter 1981). Consider two farmers who agree to help each other harvest their crops. Once the other has helped the one, she might wonder why she would still help the other. She might do so because the other will disapprove of her if she does not return the favor. However, there is a second way in which norms can affect behavior. People might regard a norm as legitimate and take themselves to have good reasons for conforming to it (Bicchieri 2006; Brennan et al. 2013). Presumably, this explains why those who violate norms typically struggle with their decision to do so (Bandura 2016). The point to appreciate is that there is often more to the decision to conform than a cost-benefit calculation.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 126)

«The norms of institutions either coordinate people’s behaviors or enable them to cooperate. Many coordination norms are of the form: first-come-first serve. Examples include norms that govern standing in line and first-occupation rules of property.

«Institutions can be regarded as solutions to coordination or cooperation problems. Coordination games have two equally good solutions that serve the interests of all players equally well, or at least more or less so. The paradigm example is driving on a particular side of the road, for instance left in the UK and right in continental Europe. In a repeated coordination game, players encounter each other in a recurrent situation. They have to decide what to do or select a strategy. The behavior that people will in fact display is a convention. The problem is, however, that there is as such no basis for preferring one option to the other.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 128)

«Sanctions can be seen as costs that affect the preferences agents have. Participants can incur these costs when they do not conform to an institution. Sanctions affect behavior because the prospect of these costs can change the preferences of the participants. Whether they do so, depends on how high these costs are and how probable it is that non-conforming behaviors are detected. When the expected costs are high enough, the game changes such that participants cooperate (Crawford 1995).³» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 129)

«In contrast, conventions are self-reinforcing. Because of this, sanctions are not needed for creating and maintaining a mutually beneficial behavioral regularity. It follows that conventions need not involve norms (Bicchieri 2006). However, conventions are rarely if ever exceptionless—both Lewis (1969, 76–80) and Bicchieri (2006, 38) allow for conventions to which not all members of the population conform. And some are more fragile than others. Because of this, norms do have a role to play with respect to conventions as well. As norms make conforming more attractive, they serve to stabilize conventional patterns of behavior. They reinforce existing ways of coordinating and thereby secure the benefits that conventions generate. Given that the function of conventions is also to generate collective benefits, coordination norms serve to prevent that conventions malfunction.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 130)

«eople might, for instance, wear a wedding ring in order to signal that they are married and that making advances is not appreciated. Although soldiers wear uniforms as camouflage during combat, they also serve to make their role salient in other contexts. Signaling devices introduce new strategies that are conditional on their presence. They expand the set of available strategies by facilitating people to act differently when they are there. This in turn enables them to align or coordinate their behaviors in ways that are beneficial to all. In this way, they give rise to conventions.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 132)

«Using ‘D’ for ‘signaling device’, the structure of such a rule is: ‘If D, do A’. Because of their conditional structure, signaling rules serve to make traffic safer and more efficient.

«The underlying concern appears to be that normativity permeates social interaction. At this point, it is important to distinguish between different kinds of normative standards: deontic and evaluative. Social norms are deontic standards in that they feature obligations. They specify what is right or wrong. However, social practices can also involve internal standards as to what a good way of performing an activity is. Just as there are better and worse ways of playing backgammon, there are, for instance, better or worse ways of being a host.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 134)

«the claim is that those who encounter a situation that constitutes a coordination game or a cooperation games are believed to be obligated to act in a particular manner and that this is generally known. This ‘normative-beliefs view’, as I call it, is a version of the theory that Brennan et al. (2013, 2–4 and 172) defend when they characterize social norms as normative principles or rules of which it is generally known that they are generally accepted. In terms of beliefs, the claim is simply that social norms are generally known normative beliefs» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 136)
\par
«The possibility of pluralistic ignorance reveals that all that is required for a social norm to exist is that people believe that they are supposed to behave in a certain way. They do not need to believe that they ought to do so. This can be explicated in terms of normative expectations. As I analyze the notion, a normative expectation is an expectation that others believe that the normative rule applies. Someone who possesses a normative expectation expects others to believe that everybody ought to behave in the manner specified by that rule. In light of this, I propose the following analysis of the existence of a social norm [E]: [E] A social norm exists in a population exactly if its normative rule features in normative expectations of a substantial number of its members. I refer to it as ‘the normative-expectations view’. It differs from the normativebeliefs view in two respect. First, the normative-expectations view does not require that the relevant individuals accept the norm (in the sense that they believe that it applies). All that is needed is that they acknowledge it (by which I mean that they believe they are supposed to conform to it). Second, in contrast to the normative-beliefs view, it does not require that people know about the attitudes that the others have. Expecting that they have a belief suffices. The normativeexpectations view allows for normative rules to feature in first-order beliefs. What is distinctive of it is that it does not require this.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 137)
\par
«Bicchieri defends a theory that is similar to the normative-expectations view in many respects. In spite of this, there are three important differences between the two. First, Bicchieri restricts the notion of a social norm to normative rules that solve cooperation problems, whereas I extend it to coordination problems. Second, she relies on a conception of normative expectations on which they are, strictly speaking, not normative. As she defines the notion, normative expectations are higher-order empirical expectations (Bicchieri 2006, 11). More precisely» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 137)
\par
«138 | Frank Hindriks A\&K someone possesses a normative expectation exactly if she expects others to expect her to conform to a descriptive rule of the form ‘Everybody do A’. To be sure, Bicchieri suggests in her informal discussion that they do involve obligations. Even so, the expectation that someone conform to a descriptive rule differs from the belief that a normative rule applies. The former is an expectation about someone’s behavior, the latter a belief about what someone ought to do.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 138)
\par
«Third, Bicchieri explicates the existence of a social norm in terms of preferences. A norm of cooperation exists exactly if a sufficient number of participants prefer to conform to it conditional on empirical and normative expectations (Bicchieri 2006, 11).⁹ Because of this, I refer to her view as ‘the conditionalpreferences view’. Nick Southwood (2018) criticizes this view by pointing out that people might secretly prefer to violate the norms that are in force conditional on others acting in this way and expecting each other to do so.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 138)
\par
«lbert Bandura (2016) observes that those who violate a norm often struggle with doing so. This makes little sense if conformity is motivated merely by sanctions.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 138)
\par
«The notion that social norms can be perceived as legitimate plays no role in equilibrium theories.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 139)
\par
«According to the conditional-preferences view, perceiving a social norm as legitimate is a matter of regarding the relevant normative expectations as wellfounded (Bicchieri 2006, 15 and 23–24). Because normative expectations can influence people’s preferences, the fact that someone perceives a norm as legitimate can provide him with motivate to act accordingly (Bicchieri 2006, 11; 2016,» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 139)
\par
«Thus, the normative-beliefs view and the conditional-preferences view have different conceptions of what is required for people to perceive a normative rule as legitimate. According to the former, all it takes is for them to possess normative beliefs that feature the rule: normative beliefs are regarded as self-justifying. In contrast, the latter explicates it in terms of them normative expectations that are regarded as justified.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 140)
\par
«Neither of these two views is fully adequate. The normative-beliefs view, according to which social norms are self-justifying, entails that people tend to regard any social norm as legitimate. However, the phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance reveals that there is a whole range of social norms for which this does not hold.¹⁰ According to the normative-expectations view, in contrast, it is a contingent matter whether a social norm is perceived as legitimate. However, it raises the question why perceived legitimacy would, in the first instance, be a matter of justified normative expectations, rather than justified normative beliefs. Someone who regards a normative expectation as justified will be inclined to form the corresponding normative belief. It seems, however, that this belief lies at the core of what it means for a social norm to be perceived as legitimate. Arguably, such a belief will be suitably justified only if the corresponding empirical and normative expectations are justified. The conditional-preferences view fails to capture these intricacies of perceived legitimacy. In contrast, the normative-expectations view explicates it in terms of normative beliefs that an agent happens to regard as justified for the reasons just mentioned. The upshot is that an agent can perceive a social norm as legitimate and that this can motivate her to conform. In this way, the social norms that feature in institutions can as such make a difference to behavior.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 140)
\par
«According to the normative-expectations view, a social norm has authority exactly if the normative beliefs people have, are in fact suitably justified. This requires that they are supported by empirical and normative expectations that are themselves not only justified but also true, which means that there is in fact an (approximately) corresponding regularity and others do in fact believe that the normative rule applies.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 141)
\par
«The idea would be that for a social norm to govern a social practice is for its participants to follow that norm. There will indeed be an institution when this condition is satisfied. However, it will also be perceived as legitimate and it will in fact have authority.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 142)
\par
«As there can be institutions that are not perceived as legitimate, the explication in terms of norm-following is too demanding. It would entail, for instance, that there is no use for sanctions, as normfollowers conform to a norm for norm-internal reasons. In practice, however, sanctions play important roles in formal as well as informal norms. Even if people are primarily motivated by norms as such, it can be that the prospect of sanctions tips the balance in favor of conformity.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 142)
\par
«An alternative proposal is that a norm governs a practice exactly if its participants, or a substantial number thereof, conform to it. This proposal is both too weak and too strong. It is too strong because an institution can exist even in the face of widespread violations. The institution of monogamy does not cease to exist, for instance, if many people cheat. It is too weak in that people might conform to a normative rule without being motivated by it. Think of the convention of driving on the right-hand side of the road. As discussed above, it is self-reinforcing. Now, suppose there is a social norm that mandates this behavior. It exists because people have the requisite normative expectations. However, it does not motivate anybody. In such a situation, the norm does not govern the practice. Instead, it is epiphenomenal. Hence, the convention does not constitute an institution. This reveals that a norm governs a practice only if it has an effect on the motivation of a substantial number of participants. It follows that norm-conformity is not sufficient for norm-governance. The upshot is that neither norm-following nor norm-conformity is necessary for norm-governance and norm-conformity is not sufficient.» (Hindriks, 2019, p. 142)

The function of a particular institution, such as money or traffic regulations, is to solve one or more cooperation problems. We go on to argue that the teleological function of institutions is to secure values by means of norms. Values can also be used to redesign an institution and to promote social change.

"This theory of the enabling role of institutions suggests naturally that the function of institutions is to bring about collectively beneficial outcomes. Schotter (1981) and Tuomela (2007, 2013) have proposed accounts of the function of institutions along these lines. Schotter regards institutions as equilibria and thereby as regularities in behavior. He defines an institution as 'a regularity in social behavior that is agreed to by all members of society, specifies behavior in recurrent situations, and is either self-policed or policed by some external authority' (Schotter 1981, p. 11). According to Schotter, institutions can be classified in terms of the problems they solve, as well as in terms of the kind of coordination mechanism they rely on. Schotter argues that their function is 'to make our lives more efficient', or to solve collective problems 'with a minimum of social resources' (Schotter 1981, p. 22)."

"According to Wright's (1973) etiological conception, an entity has function F exactly if the following two conditions are satisfied: First, the entity is there because it does F; second, F is a consequence of the entity's being there. According to the first condition, the fact that the entity does F accounts for its existence (the heart is there because it circulates blood). The second condition reveals that the fact that it does F is not an accident (the heart plays a non-redundant role in explaining the circulation of blood).6 This etiological concept is closely related to that of an equilibrium, or so we argue" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9L585GUK?page=6}{Hindriks and Guala 2021:2032})

"Note, however, that the attribution of a function to the heart does not require a complete history of this organ.

"The existence and persistence of an institution is due to the fact that its deontic powers are collectively accepted. For Searle, however, there is no causal connection between the fact that those powers are fulfilled and the fact that an institution remains in existence. For example, the authoritarian government of an impoverished country remains in power as long as it is collectively accepted, irrespective of whether it serves a purpose. This disassociation between the causal mechanism that sustains institutions, on the one hand, and their functions, on the other, highlights the non-etiological nature of Searle's functions."

"Although Miller recognizes that they often involve unintended consequences, he argues that institutions serve to realize what he calls 'collective ends.' A collective end is an individual end held in common by a number of individuals that is (to be) realized by all or most of them. Joint actions are interdependent individual actions directed at collective ends. Each individual who performs a joint action adopts a particular collective end, intentionally performs an action that contributes to this end, believes that every other individual did, does, or will do so, and mutually believes that all of this is the case. Institutions are joint activities governed by social norms in accordance with collective ends. Finally, the function of an institution is to realize the collective end that defines it (Miller 2010, p. 25)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9L585GUK?page=12}{Hindriks and Guala 2021:2038})

"The problem with Miller's normative account is not that it is wrong, but that it is rather limited. Recall that, on our reconstruction of Miller's theory, the teleological function of institutions is to secure joint moral rights by providing collective goods. The attraction of our theory, we propose, is that it is both more flexible and more general. Miller's approach is tied to a particular way of evaluating institutions, to wit in terms of joint moral rights that are based on a particular moral code. Furthermore, it is moralized in that this is deemed to be the right way of evaluating institutions. Miller is committed to the claim that an institution that underperforms harbors agents that violate moral rights. In contrast, our approach is not tied to a particular moral code."

In contrast, rule theories explicate them in terms of a standard that people are supposed to meet. I propose that, when an institution is weak, a discrepancy exists between the regularity and the standard or rule. To capture this discrepancy, I present a hybrid theory, the Rules-and-Equilibria Theory. According to this theory, institutions are rule-governed behavioural regularities. The Rules-and-Equilibria Theory provides the basis for two measures of institutional strength. First, institutions that pertain to coordination games solve problems of information. Their strength is primarily a matter of the expected degree of compliance. Second, institutions that concern mixed-motive games solve problems of motivation. Their strength can be measured in terms of the weight people attribute to its rule.},

This also empowers the person whose behavior is being observed: By intelligently modifying her actions, she can influence the mental representations that an observer ascribes to her, and by extension, what the observer comes to believe about the world. That is, she can engage in intentionally communicative demonstrations. Here, we develop a computational account of generating and interpreting communicative demonstrations by explicitly distinguishing between two interacting types of planning. Typically, instrumental planning aims to control states of the environment, whereas belief-directed planning aims to influence an observer’s mental representations. Our framework extends existing formal models of pragmatics and pedagogy to the setting of value-guided decision-making, captures how people modify their intentional behavior to show what they know about the reward or causal structure of an environment, and helps explain data on infant and child imitation in terms of literal versus pragmatic interpretation of adult demonstrators’ actions. Additionally, our analysis of belief-directed intentionality and mentalizing sheds light on the socio-cognitive mechanisms that underlie distinctly human forms of communication, culture, and sociality.},

  abstract = {Though human beings embody a unique ability for planned behavior, they also often act impulsively. This insight may be important for the study of self-control situations in which people are torn between their long-term goals to restrain behavior and their immediate impulses that promise hedonic fulfillment. In the present article, we outline a dual-systems perspective of impulse and self-control and suggest a framework for the prediction of self-control outcomes. This framework combines three elements that, considered jointly, may enable a more precise prediction of self-control outcomes than they do when studied in isolation: impulsive precursors of behavior, reflective precursors, and situational or dispositional boundary conditions. The theoretical and practical utility of such an approach is demonstrated by drawing on recent evidence from several domains of self-control such as eating, drinking, and sexual behavior.},

  abstract = {There is a long history of worrying about whether or not metaphysics is a legitimate philosophical discipline. Traditionally such worries center around issues of meaning and epistemological concerns. Do the metaphysical questions have any meaning? Can metaphysical methodology lead to knowledge? But these questions are, in my opinion, not as serious as they have sometimes (historically) been taken to be. What is much more concerning is another set of worries about metaphysics, which I take to be the greatest threat to metaphysics as a philosophical discipline. These worries, in effect, hold that the questions that metaphysics tries to answer have long been answered in other parts of inquiry, ones that have much greater authority. And if they haven’t been answered yet then one should not look to philosophy for an answer. What metaphysics tries to do has been or will be done by the sciences. There is nothing left to do for philosophy, or so the worry. Let me illustrate this with two examples, one of which is our main concern here. 1.1 Two Examples The most striking examples where it seems that the question metaphysics tries to answer has been answered long ago outside of philosophy are examples from ontology. These will be our main concern in this paper. One of the central questions in the philosophy of mathematics is an ontological question: are there any mathematical objects? If there are then a certain story of mathematical truth and objectivity will have to be told, and if there are not then a completely different one has to be right. This is supposed to be a large-scale philosophical question about mathematics. It’s the question whether or not there are math-ematical objects. But it seems that this question is not a philosophical question at all. It is one that is easily answered within mathematics. Mathematics has},

  abstract = {The free energy principle says that any self-organising system that is at nonequilibrium steady-state with its environment must minimize its (variational) free energy. It is proposed as a grand unifying principle for cognitive science and biology. The principle can appear cryptic, esoteric, too ambitious, and unfalsifiable—suggesting it would be best to suspend any belief in the principle, and instead focus on individual, more concrete and falsifiable ‘process theories’ for particular biological processes and phenomena like perception, decision and action. Here, I explain the free energy principle, and I argue that it is best understood as offering a conceptual and mathematical analysis of the concept of existence of self-organising systems. This analysis offers a new type of solution to long-standing problems in neurobiology, cognitive science, machine learning and philosophy concerning the possibility of normatively constrained, self-supervised learning and inference. The principle can therefore uniquely serve as a regulatory principle for process theories, to ensure that process theories conforming to it enable self-supervision. This is, at least for those who believe self-supervision is a foundational explanatory task, good reason to believe the free energy principle.},

After rejecting Neander's own proposal in terms of second-order similarity and a proposal inspired by Ruth Millikan in terms of simplicity, I offer a solution which equates functions with manifestations of dispositions that made a difference to evolutionary success. My suggestion is able to generate determinate and plausible contents for new perceptual states while still preserving the idea that etiological functions explain evolutionary success.}

After showing how mathematics can play either a representational or an explanatory role by considering two alternative explanations of a same biological pattern—“Bergmann’s rule”—I offer an example of an explanation where the bulk of the explanatory job is done by a mathematical theorem, and where mechanisms involved in the target systems are not explanatorily relevant. Then I account for the way mathematical properties may function in an explanatory way within an explanation by arguing that some mathematical propositions involving variables non directly referring to the target system features constitute constraints to which a whole class of systems should comply, provided they are describable by a mathematical object concerned by those propositions. According to such “constraint account”, those mathematical facts are directly entailing the explanandum (often a limit regime, a robustness property or a steady state), as a consequence of such constraints. I call those explanations “structural”, because here properties of mathematical structures are accounting for the explanandum; various kinds of mathematical structures (algebraic, graph-theoretical, etc.) thereby define various types of structural explanations.},

They can be analyzed in terms of rational choice theory and in terms of evolutionary game theory.

To substantiate these arguments, I will look at models similar to those of Skyrms (2000) and Komarova and Niyogi (2004) and study their dynamical properties. My results will lend partial support to the thesis that evolution leads to communication. In general, states of partial communication may evolve with positive probability under standard evolutionary dynamics.

«Skyrms (1996) invites us to approach the problem of the emergence and stability of language conventions from an evolutionary standpoint. If an adaptive process governs a population of individuals that are repeatedly confronted with a situation that is similar enough to a signaling game, will one of the signaling systems eventually become established in this population? Biological evidence suggests that the answer to this question is, at least a cautious, yes. Signal coordination is everywhere, from cells communicating via molecules and the honeybee’s dance to predator alarm calls of monkeys and bird song (for comprehensive treatments of animal signals, see Snowdon [1990], Hauser [1997], and Maynard Smith and Harper [2003]).» (Huttegger, 2007, p. 9)

It then details the reasons why so many find cognitivist interpretations to be inevitable. Section~2 examines how prominent proponents of cognitivist PPC have proposed dealing with a fundamental problem that troubles their accounts—the question of how the brain is able to get into the great guessing game in the first place. It is argued that on close inspection Clark’s (2016) solution, which he calls bootstrap heaven is—once we take a realistic look at the situation of the brain—in fact bootstrap hell. Section~3 argues that it is possible to avoid dwelling in bootstrap hell if one adopts a radically enactive take on PPC. A brief sketch of what this might look like is provided.},

"Located as we are at a perilous intersection of the "two cultures" of Western thought, the humanities and sciences (Snow 2001[1959]), our ontology is constructionist because we are interested in how groups of people come to interpret the social world the way they do. But in embracing cognitive science and cognate disciplines, our ontology is also implicitly realist. We implicitly accept that experiments and magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs) reveal real empirical social cognitive phenomena (schémas, biases, types of cognition) that can be said to have causal powers. The findings of cognitive science, neuroscience, and so forth are interpretations of reality but they are interpretations that assume that reality exists independent of our interpretation."

In particular, this paper offers an account of non causal structural explanation that forms an alternative to causal-mechanical accounts of model explanation that are currently popular in philosophy of biology and cognitive science. Clearly, defences of non-causal explanation are far from new (e.g. Batter man, Br J Philos Sci 53:21-38, 2002a; The devil in the details: asymptotic reasoning in explanation, reduction, and emergence, 2002b; Pincock, Nous 41:253-275, 2007; Mathematics and scientific representation 2012; Rice, Nous, doi: 10.1111/nous. 12042, 2013; Biol Philos 27:685-703, 2012), so the targets here are focused on a particular type of robust phenomenon and how strong invariance to interventions can block a range of causal explanations.

The two principles upon which the theory rest are the Principle of Insufficient Reason (IR) and a Principle of Individual Team Member Rationality. The way IR is modelled combines the classic notion of description symmetry and a new notion of pay-off symmetry, which yields different predictions in a variety of games. The theory can explain why people do better than pure randomization in matching games.},

Some laws are fundamental in the sense that they are the result of inductive generalisations of observed regularities and at the same time in their formulation contain a new theoretical predicate. The inductive generalisations simultaneously function as implicit definitions of these new predicates. Other laws are either explicit definitions or consequences of other previously established laws. I discuss the laws of classical mechanics, relativity theory and electromagnetism in detail. Laws are necessary, whereas accidental generalisations are not. But necessity here is not a modal concept, but rather interpreted as short for the semantic predicate “... is necessarily true”. Thus no modal logic is needed. The necessity attributed to law sentences is in turn interpreted as “necessary condition for the rest of the theory”, which is true since fundamental laws are implicit definitions of theoretical predicates use in the theory.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

I first revisit Robert K. Merton’s original ideas on middle‐range theories and identify a tension between his developmental approach to middle‐range theorizing that recognizes multiple functions of theories in sociological research and his static definition of the concept of middle‐range theory that focuses only on empirical testing of theories. Drawing on Merton's ideas on theorizing and recent discussions on mechanism‐based explanations, I argue that this tension can be resolved by decomposing a middle‐range theory into three interrelated and evolving components that perform different functions in sociological research: (i) a conceptual framework about social phenomena that is a set of interrelated concepts that evolve in close connection with empirical analysis; (ii) a mechanism schema that is an abstract and incomplete description of a social mechanism; and (iii) a cluster of all mechanism‐based explanations of social phenomena that are based on the particular mechanism schema. I show how these components develop over time and how they serve different functions in sociological theorizing and research. Finally, I illustrate these ideas by discussing Merton’s theory of the Matthew effect in science and its more recent applications in sociology.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {Exactly what makes an interaction between two organisms a case of communication is contentious. Historically, debate has taken place between definitions of communication invoking information transmission vs definitions invoking causal influence. More recently, there has been some convergence on a hybrid definition: invoking (co-adapted) causal influence mediated via the transmission of information. After proposing an understanding of what it means to say that a receiver is causally influenced by the transmission of information, I argue that an information-mediated influence definition overextends to include most, indeed maybe all, co-adapted interactions. This is because the transmission of correlational information is actually a feature of most, if not all, co-adapted interactions. I end by considering whether adding an arbitrariness criterion to an information-mediated influence definition helps. After giving an account of what arbitrariness amounts to, I argue that it swings things too far in the opposite direction: we go from a definition of communication that is too liberal to one that is too restrictive. This is because many signal kinds are not arbitrary. It turns out to be extremely difficult to capture what makes communication unique.}

The book drives to the heart of the exciting debate on the origins of life and maintenance of order in complex biological systems. It focuses on the concept of self-organization: the spontaneous emergence of order that is widely observed throughout nature Kauffman argues that self-organization plays an important role in the Darwinian process of natural selection. Yet until now no systematic effort has been made to incorporate the concept of self-organization into evolutionary theory. The construction requirements which permit complex systems to adapt are poorly understood, as is the extent to which selection itself can yield systems able to adapt more successfully. This book explores these themes. It shows how complex systems, contrary to expectations, can spontaneously exhibit stunning degrees of order, and how this order, in turn, is essential for understanding the emergence and development of life on Earth. Topics include the new biotechnology of applied molecular evolution, with its important implications for developing new drugs and vaccines; the balance between order and chaos observed in many naturally occurring systems; new insights concerning the predictive power of statistical mechanics in biology; and other major issues. Indeed, the approaches investigated here may prove to be the new center around which biological science itself will evolve.

The model predicts that “parity promotes peace”: in the pure-strategy equilibrium, agents with relatively symmetric conflict capabilities agree to resolve the conflict by using a random device; however, with sufficiently asymmetric capabilities, conflicts are unavoidable because the stronger agent prefers to fight. The results of the experiment confirm that the availability of the random device partially eliminates conflicts when agents are relatively symmetric; however, the device also reduces conflict between substantially asymmetric agents.},

Different social science traditions emphasize one or the other of these claims for different reasons at different times in their history, making a cohesive narrative difficult."

\par
"Most of the key founding figures in sociology and anthropology — Comte, Spencer, Marx, Durkheim, Weber, Radcliff-Brown, and Malinowski — espoused versions of functionalism. Comte [1974], who coined the term sociology, had a fundamental interest in the foundations of social order combined with the common 19th century belief that useful analogies can be drawn between biological organisms and societies. He also had to fight for the legitimacy of sociology as a discipline, and he may have done so by appealing to similarities between the new social science and the much more established science of biology. Organic analogies and a concern with stability thus led naturally to the idea that society was composed of a set of interlocking component social parts — families, classes, and cities were his favorite elements — and that these parts contribute in different ways to the stability of the whole. That contribution was their function." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IB4IG7CN?page=3}{Kincaid 2007:215})
\par
"Max Weber [1978] was openly critical of organic analogies and the unilinear evolution found in the early functionalists. Yet, demonstrating once again the appeal of functionalist accounts and the Darwinian mechanism of variation and selection, Weber's concrete empirical analyses of social phenomena extend the kind of selective mechanism found in Marx and Baldwin [Runciman, 2001]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IB4IG7CN?page=4}{Kincaid 2007:216})
\par
"Durkheim [1965] is the most influential of the early functionalists. He borrowed Spencer's structure/function distinction, but put it to an empirical use that Spencer did not. In The Division of Labor in Society [1933] and The Elementary Forms of Religious Life [1961] Durkheim argued that particular social institutions serve to promote social solidarity. The division of labor does so by increasing interdependence among individuals. Religious beliefs symbolize the society in which they are embedded and thereby promote social integration. He backed up both with extensive empirical discussions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IB4IG7CN?page=5}{Kincaid 2007:217})
\par
"Durkheim's functionalism sometime extended beyond identifying functions to explaining institutions as existing because of their functions. He explicitly separates causes of social phenomena from their functional effects. Yet he appeals to a Darwinian competition mechanism (explicitly invoking Darwin) in discussing the division of labor: increasing population causes increasing competition which results in increasing specialization. It looks like the division of labor exists because it allows societies to successfully function in the face of individual competition. Arguably we have here again the ongoing tension between functionalism as analyzing the role of parts in the whole and as providing a causal mechanism based on those roles." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IB4IG7CN?page=5}{Kincaid 2007:217})
\par
"I won't try to sketch the corresponding history of criticism that functionalism generated, for most of the standard criticisms are present in some from the beginnings in the 19th century. Rather let me list some of the most important: Questions about mechanism and illegitimate teleology: Many [Elster, 1983; Vayda, 1987; Little, 1989] claim that functional explanations do not provide mechanism connecting beneficial practices with their effects and are thus unconfirmed and/or inadequate explanations. Because there is no mechanism, functional explanations end up with a mystical form of teleology — the need for social institutions makes them exist. Questions about change, diversity and agency [Layton, 1997]: In its Parsonian form, for example, functionalism sees society as a self-maintaining system where social control is emphasized at the expense of individual agency and societal conflict and cultural diversity downplayed in favor of universal societal components. Questions about illegitimate use of biological explanations [Ellen, 1982; Hallpike, 1986; Fraccia and Lewontin, 1999; Bryant, 2004]. Societies do not have clear boundaries, do not have the equivalent of genes, do not reproduce, do not merely react to their environments but change them, have guided rather than blind change, and are not populations of traits. All of these differences show that biological analogies to natural selection and organismic organization have no legitimate place. Questions about tautology and vacuousness [Hallpike, 1986]: A persisting charge against functional explanation is its lack of content. This flaw is seen in various aspects of functional explanation. The essence of functionalism seems to be the 4As a rough guide, contemporary work breaks down into traditional sociological theorizing influenced by Parsons [Alexander, 1985; Luhman, 1995], rational choice game theory, evolutionary game theory [Bowles, 2004], cultural selection theory [Boyd and Richerson, 1985; Durham, 1991; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1981], mimetics [Aunger, 2000], behavioral ecology [Smith, 1992] and evolutionary archeology [Lyman and O'Brien, 1998]."

\par
"220 Harold Kincaid claim that stable societies survive, where to be stable is to persist and thus survive. Or societies are said to adapt, but adapting is given no more content than simply "try to cope with their situation." Neither claim seems to be saying anything nontrivial. Functionalists' predilection for putting societies or their practices into complex and highly abstract classificatory schemes likewise seems nonexplanatory."

"According to Cohen, functional explanations are a kind of consequence explanation — explaining the existence of something because of the consequences it has. To show that social practiceA exists in order toB, we have to show that it is a law that whenA has a disposition to produceB,A comes to exist. Cohen uses this account to clarify Marx's functionalism. The relations of production exist in order to promote the forces of production in that it is a law that when new class relations would promote technological progress, they come to exist."

"Game theory is a useful technology or tool. But by itself it does not unify the social sciences or support individualism. It does not have that much content; content has to be filled in to apply it. Greif's actors are clans not individuals. The game theory analysis works by building on sociological understanding, not replacing it. The connections between economic, political and psychological accounts of the social world are not made simply by the use of a common technology, but by the substantive attempts to interconnect them in concrete explanations."

"Determining what game is actually being played, if any, can be difficult because many of the defining components of the game may be unobservable. The classic question here is inferring the utility functions of the agents, when only behavior is observed. This is complicated by the fact that real agents occupy many roles at once and thus may be playing multiple games, including metagames — games about what games to play (see [Ross, 2005]). Needless to say, this can make presenting a convincing case quite difficult.10" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/IB4IG7CN?page=18}{Kincaid 2007:230})

"Suppose the claim is that, for example, a specific norm exists in order to capture gains from cooperation. Then we are claiming that the norm's function is the complete cause of its persistence. The mechanism supposedly realizing that process is alleged to be rational choices of individuals. However, what rational individuals should choose in the situation of multiple equilibria is underdetermined, so we have good reason to think our claim is false — that the norm's benefits are not the full cause of its persistence."

I argue and try to show instead that if there are fruitful questions of social ontology, they are probably mostly local empirical issues raised by specific pieces of social science.

  abstract = {Cognition has traditionally been understood in terms of internal mental representations, and computational operations carried out on internal mental representations. Radical approaches propose to reconceive cognition in terms of agent-environment dynamics. An outstanding challenge for such a philosophical project is how to scale-up from perception and action to cases of what is typically called 'higher-order' cognition such as linguistic thought, the case we focus on in this paper. Perception and action are naturally described in terms of agent-environment dynamics, but can a person's thoughts about absent, abstract or counterfactual states of affairs also be accounted for in such terms? We argue such a question will seem pressing so long as one fails to appreciate how richly resourceful the human ecological niche is in terms of the affordances it provides. The explanatory work that is supposedly done by mental representations in a philosophical analysis of cognition, can instead be done by looking outside of the head to the environment structured by sociomaterial practices, and the affordances it makes available. Once one recognizes how much of the human ecological niche has become structured by activities of talking and writing, this should take away at least some of the motivation for understanding linguistic thinking in terms of content-bearing internal representations. We'll argue that people can think about absent, abstract or counterfactual because of their skills for engaging with what we will call "enlanguaged affordances". We make use of the phenomenological analysis of speech in Merleau-Ponty to show how the multiple affordances an individual is ready to engage with in a particular situation will typically include enlanguaged affordances.}

Since Hutto and Myin have to account for language purely in terms of joint action guidance, there is no reason why simpler communication systems, such as cellular signaling pathways, should not give rise to scaffolded content as well. This conclusion remains valid even if one rejects the view of language as mediated through public symbols and embraces global antirepresentationalism.

FEP holds that cognitive systems encode generative models of their niches and cognition can be understood in terms of minimizing the free energy of these models. There are two philosophical interpretations of this picture. A computationalist will argue that as FEP claims that Bayesian inference underpins both perception and action, it entails a concept of cognition as a computational process. An enactivist, on the other hand, will point out that FEP explains cognitive systems as constantly self-organizing to non-equilibrium steady-state. My claim is that these two interpretations are both true at the same time and that they enlighten each other.},

In the presented method, a sender-receiver dyad is first trained with a disentangled 					pair of objectives, and then the receiver is transferred to train a new sender with a standard objective. Unlike other methods 					(e.g. the obverter algorithm), the template transfer approach does not require imposing inductive biases on the architecture of 					the agents. We experimentally show the emergence of compositional communication using topographical similarity, zero-shot 					generalization and context-independence as evaluation metrics. The presented approach is connected to an important line of work in 					semiotics and developmental psycholinguistics: it supports a conjecture that compositional communication is scaffolded on simpler 					communication protocols.},

We recorded EEG from an observer monitoring two individuals who were occasionally communicating with each other via either mutual eye contact and/or pointing gestures, and then jointly attending to the same object or attending to different objects that were placed on a table in front of them. The analyses were focussed on the processing of the interaction outcome (i.e. presence or absence of joint attention) and showed that its interpretation is a two-stage process, as reflected in the N300 and the N400 potentials. The N300 amplitude was reduced when the two individuals shared their focus of attention, which indicates the operation of a cognitive process that involves the relatively fast identification and evaluation of actor–object relationships. On the other hand, the N400 was insensitive to the sharing or distribution of the two individuals’ attentional focus. Interestingly, the N400 was reduced when the interaction outcome was preceded either by mutual eye contact or by a perceived pointing gesture. This shows that observation of communication “opens up” the mind to a wider range of action possibilities and thereby helps to interpret unusual outcomes of social interactions.},

Most approaches to this problem treat the mismatch between the ontological truth and ordinary belief as superficial or not even real. By contrast, I propose what I call the "uncompromising solution". First, I argue that our beliefs about material objects were influenced by evolutionary forces that were independent of the ontological truth. Second, I draw an analogy between the Problem of Reasonableness and the New Evil Demon Problem and argue that the revisionary ontologist can always find a positive epistemic status to characterize ordinary people's beliefs about material objects. Finally, I address the worry that the evolutionary component of my story also threatens to undermine the best arguments for revisionary ontologies.}

  abstract = {In this paper I suggest that play is a distinctive behavioural category whose adaptive significance calls for explanation. Play primarily affords juveniles practice toward the exercise of later skills. Its benefits exceed its costs when sufficient practice would otherwise be unlikely or unsafe, as is particularly true with physical skills and socially competitive ones. Manipulative play with objects is a byproduct of increased intelligence, specifically selected for only in a few advanced primates, notably the chimpanzee.The adaptiveness of play in pongid evolution is traced through the probable changes in selective pressures that occurred in hominid evolution. It is argued that fantasy was an emergent property in hominids, made possible by symbolic intelligence and language, and serving to make play complex enough to continue to provide useful practice for increasingly complex later skills.The advent of organised instruction and education has meant that play's unplanned, intrinisic goal-setting could be replaced by extrinsic goal-setting in the systematic development of particular skills. However, the need to ensure adequate motivation has continued to give play educational value. In addition, its capacity to enhance innovative behaviour seems to be a residual function of play which has acquired a new cultural importance.},

  abstract = {I introduce an extension of the Lewis–Skyrms signaling game, analysed from a dynamical perspective via simple reinforcement learning. In Lewis’ (Convention, Blackwell, Oxford, 1969) conception of a signaling game, salience is offered as an explanation for how individuals may come to agree upon a linguistic convention. Skyrms (Signals: evolution, learning \& information, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2010a) offers a dynamic explanation of how signaling conventions might arise presupposing no salience whatsoever. The extension of the atomic signaling game examined here—which I will refer to as a salience game—introduces a variable parameter into the atomic signaling game which allows for degrees of salience, thus filling in the continuum between Skyrms’ and Lewis’ models. The model does not presuppose any salience at the outset, but illustrates a process by which accidentally evolved salience is amplified, to the benefit of the players. It is shown that increasing degrees of salience allow populations to avoid sub-optimal pooling equilibria and to coordinate upon conventions more quickly.},

In addition to showing how recent metaphysics has drifted away from connection with all other serious scholarly inquiry as a result of not heeding this restriction, they demonstrate how to build a metaphysics compatible with current fundamental physics ('ontic structural realism'), which, when combined with their metaphysics of the special sciences ('rainforest realism'), can be used to unify physics with the other sciences without reducing these sciences to physics itself. Taking science metaphysically seriously, Ladyman and Ross argue, means that metaphysicians must abandon the picture of the world as composed of self-subsistent individual objects, and the paradigm of causation as the collision of such objects. Every Thing Must Go also assesses the role of information theory and complex systems theory in attempts to explain the relationship between the special sciences and physics, treading a middle road between the grand synthesis of thermodynamics and information, and eliminativism about information. The consequences of the author's metaphysical theory for central issues in the philosophy of science are explored, including the implications for the realism vs. empiricism debate, the role of causation in scientific explanations, the nature of causation and laws, the status of abstract and virtual objects, and the objective reality of natural kinds.},

Today, we are experiencing once again a period of enthusiasm, fired above all by the successes of the technology of deep neural networks or deep machine learning. In this paper we draw attention to what we take to be serious problems underlying current views of artificial intelligence encouraged by these successes, especially in the domain of language processing. We then show an alternative approach to language-centric AI, in which we identify a role for philosophy.}

"Some philosophers are optimistic that social ontology so conceived can promote empirical success in the social sciences,1 where it has long been observed that certain kinds of scientific achievements have remained out of reach, for example, novel and precise prediction (Elster 2009; Epstein 2015; Rosenberg 1992). In particular, Epstein (2015) and Searle (2008) argue that social ontology can promote success both in prediction and in explanation by providing a correct picture of the social world." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=2}{Lauer 2019:172})
\par
"The argument I identify as the core argument shared between instances of OM! says that ontology contributes to the success of science (success in explanation and prediction) because answering ontological questions can contribute to empirical success. Searle and Epstein have both made the case for a priori ontological reasoning, drawing broadly on tools from analytic philosophy to achieve their aims. If their arguments are successful, this suggests that successful ontological theorizing, that which cuts the (social) world at the joints, plays a crucial role the progress of science. I refer to these arguments as "realist OM! arguments."" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=2}{Lauer 2019:172})
\par
"I present a pragmatic alternative to realist OM! arguments. Instead of relying on the idea that scientifically useful social ontology cuts the social world at its joints, the pragmatic alternative states that the desirability of a social ontology depends on its empirical merits." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=2}{Lauer 2019:172})
\par
"OM! arguments support the claim that social ontology matters to the achievement of prediction and explanation in social science. According to those advancing these arguments, social ontology matters because a better ontology can aid in the generation of predictive and/or explanatory improvements for the social sciences. If we have a better philosophical or prescientific understanding of the social world, joined with our best scientific methods, then we should expect explanatory and/or predictive success in the social sciences. This allows concepts derived in social ontology a place in our scientific toolkit and allows social ontology to be a part of the process of theory construction. Conversely, the absence of explanatory and/or predictive success in the social sciences signals a deficiency in our philosophical or prescientific understanding of the social world." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=3}{Lauer 2019:173})
\par
"Consider some examples. Searle (2008, 443) argues, I believe that where the social sciences are concerned, social ontology is prior to methodology and theory. It is prior in the sense that unless you have a clear conception of the nature of the phenomena you are investigating, you are unlikely to develop the right methodology and the right theoretical apparatus for conducting the investigation. Searle's "unless" suggests that in the absence of a clear conception of the social world, we should not expect successful social science." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=3}{Lauer 2019:173})
\par
"Similarly, Little (2016, 1) argues," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=3}{Lauer 2019:173})
\par
"4 Philosophy of the Social Sciences 00(0) . . . I believe that the social sciences need to be framed out of consideration for a better understanding of the nature of the social—a better social ontology—if we are to be more successful in understanding and explaining the processes of social change the twenty-first century presents." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=4}{Lauer 2019:174})
\par
"Epstein (2015, 127) produces similar arguments, Ontology has ramifications, and ontological mistakes lead to scientific mistakes. Commitments about the nature of the entities in a science—how they are composed, the entities on which they ontologically depend—are woven into the models of the science. By Epstein's premises, the mistaken ontology of a model or theory can lead to scientific mistakes, particularly those concerning prediction and explanation. An ontology that is "mistaken" is an ontology that fails to cut at the world's joints. Consider, for example, Epstein's (2015, 44) use of Virchow's cell theory. Virchow treated organisms as entirely composed of cells. This led to mistaken explanations of some phenomena (for example, tooth decay).2" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=4}{Lauer 2019:174})
\par
"List and Pettit (2011) argue for something like OM! in their introductory discussion of group agency—they use Dennett's (1987) intentional stance. Their position is that a stance toward a social system that treats it as a particular kind of thing can promote the generation of new hypotheses which may help to produce explanations or interventions to which we might otherwise be blind." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=4}{Lauer 2019:174})
\par
"Taken together, these arguments visit common themes. Each suggests that we ought to investigate what there is for the purposes of improving social scientific models and theories. Moreover, each suggests that this can be done by way of ontological theorizing. For Epstein and Searle, this is a matter of deriving a priori frameworks that entail ontological conclusions, which, if correct, aid in generating correct explanations (and, in Epstein's case, accurate predictions) of social phenomena. In Lohse's case, this is a matter of exploring those ontological commitments implicit in social scientific theories—this means answering questions about what theories require of the world and whether these requirements are met. In sum, OM! arguments suggest that the success of science depends on ontology to the extent that correctly identifying properties of the world will aid in producing successful science." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=5}{Lauer 2019:175})
\par
"How valuable is the role afforded to social ontology? Given the role of the social sciences, particularly economics, in directing and formulating policy, it is significant. Consider an analogy to van Fraassen's (2002, 15) argument against analytic ontology5: he argues that there are considerable differences in the payoffs we can expect when choosing between scientific theories and ontological theories. In medicine, the truth of scientists' beliefs about the effectiveness of a medicine comes with significant moral stakes. If scientists have false beliefs about the effectiveness of a medicine, many people may be harmed and if they believe truly, many people may benefit. In ontology, van Fraassen argues, the stakes seem to concern only the truth and falsehood of our beliefs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=7}{Lauer 2019:177})
\par
"Debates over the correctness of these views go back to the debate between Quine and Carnap about the nature of ontological commitment. Famously, Quine's (1953) view was that to be is to be the value of a bound variable— there is no variation in meaning for "∃," either something serves as the value of the variable attached to the existential quantifier or it does not. Here it is natural to consider the concept of a logical domain. To say that something is an F is just to say that there is something in a specified logical domain that is an F. This is unlike Carnap (1950), who famously distinguished external and internal existence questions. The former concern those things that exist apart from the language we use. The latter concern those things whose existence is implied by a linguistic framework. For each of these questions, one can posit a distinct existential quantifier. Thus, Quine exemplifies the univocalist position while Carnap exemplifies the equivocalist position." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=9}{Lauer 2019:179})
\par
"Pragmatic view: Social ontology can aid in empirical success by introducing statements into our social scientific theories/models that make them empirically adequate. These statements do not entail a commitment to what there is. Realist view: Social ontology can aid in empirical success through the successful answering of ontological questions. Social scientific theories and models become empirically adequate by determining what there is." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=13}{Lauer 2019:183})
\par
"Consider each of these positions applied to Epstein's Starbucks example. 1. Realist view: The statement "Some non-individuals are causes of insolvency" is true and enables the inference to the prediction and/or explanandum describing Starbucks' insolvency (where this entails that these non-individuals exist). 2. Pragmatic view: The statement "Some non-individuals are causes of insolvency" enables the inference to the prediction and/or explanandum describing Starbucks's insolvency (but does not entail that there are nonindividuals)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=13}{Lauer 2019:183})
\par
"The foregoing discussion suggests that proponents of realist OM! arguments, if they require that answers to ontological questions deploy ∃dc, have a special burden. This is the burden of arguing that a traditional conception of social ontology (an account of what there is in the social world) contributes to success in social science because this practice leads to ontologies that successfully cut at the social world's joints. Otherwise, parsimony should push us to prefer the pragmatic view because it seems we can account for ontological choice without realism." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9PHKCXTH?page=16}{Lauer 2019:186})
\par
"The pragmatic position as I have described it here suggests the same for social science—in social science, we need not answer ontological questions (questions and answers using "∃dc") to do successful social science. Yet, when we bring metaontological considerations to bear on OM! arguments, there is some suggestion that, in fact, we should assume that such questions are answered or must be answered. That is, there is a presumption of realism contained in the OM! arguments presented in the literature that requires justification."

First, humans and other animals routinely alter their behavior in response to changes in their physical and social environment. As a result, the outcomes of decisions that depend on the behavior of multiple decision makers are difficult to predict and require highly adaptive decision-making strategies. Second, decision makers may have preferences regarding consequences to other individuals and therefore choose their actions to improve or reduce the well-being of others. Many neurobiological studies have exploited game theory to probe the neural basis of decision making and suggested that these features of social decision making might be reflected in the functions of brain areas involved in reward evaluation and reinforcement learning. Molecular genetic studies have also begun to identify genetic mechanisms for personal traits related to reinforcement learning and complex social decision making, further illuminating the biological basis of social behavior.},

  abstract = {Speakers often do not state requests directly but employ innuendos such as Would you like to see my etchings? Though such indirectness seems puzzlingly inefficient, it can be explained by a theory of the strategic speaker, who seeks plausible deniability when he or she is uncertain of whether the hearer is cooperative or antagonistic. A paradigm case is bribing a policeman who may be corrupt or honest: A veiled bribe may be accepted by the former and ignored by the latter. Everyday social interactions can have a similar payoff structure (with emotional rather than legal penalties) whenever a request is implicitly forbidden by the relational model holding between speaker and hearer (e.g., bribing an honest maitre d’, where the reciprocity of the bribe clashes with his authority). Even when a hearer’s willingness is known, indirect speech offers higher-order plausible deniability by preempting certainty, gossip, and common knowledge of the request. In supporting experiments, participants judged the intentions and reactions of characters in scenarios that involved fraught requests varying in politeness and directness.},

Meaning is provided to events from the perspective of hindsight, but with reference to horizons of meaning. Whereas “natural selection” is based on genotypes that are observable (like DNA), cultural selection mechanisms are not hard-wired, but evolve. The “genotypes” of cultural evolution are codes in the communication which can operate as selections upon one another. Local instantiations shape trajectories; regimes operate as selection pressure with reference to the next-order horizons of meaning. These orders of expectations can operate incursively and hyper-incursively against the arrow of time and thus generate redundancies: (i) horizons of meaning can be expected to overlap and (ii) distinctions generate new options enlarging the maximum capacities. Information theory and the theory of anticipatory systems can be used for the elaboration of operations against the arrow of time. New options can be a synergetic effect of interactions among codes in the communication and serve as sources of wealth in a knowledge-based economy.},

This review examines four broad areas of research within social cognitive neuroscience: (a) understanding others, (b) understanding oneself, (c) controlling oneself, and (d ) the processes that occur at the interface of self and others. In addition, this review highlights two core-processing distinctions that can be neurocognitively identified across all of these domains. The distinction between automatic versus controlled processes has long been important to social psychological theory and can be dissociated in the neural regions contributing to social cognition. Alternatively, the differentiation between internally-focused processes that focus on one’s own or another’s mental interior and externally-focused processes that focus on one’s own or another’s visible features and actions is a new distinction. This latter distinction emerges from social cognitive neuroscience investigations rather than from existing psychological theories demonstrating that social cognitive neuroscience can both draw on and contribute to social psychological theory.},

The contributions approach the topic from either an integrated history and philosophy of science perspective, 2) a systematic philosophical perspective, or 3) a historical perspective. This overview article is organized in three sections. The introduction provides some background and context of the topic. The second section specifies the three components of knowledge transfer, i.e., knowledge, context, and the transfer process. It motivates our take on this topic and then outlines the central ideas of each paper. The third section reflects on the kinds of methods used to study processes of knowledge transfer. The article concludes by highlighting some of the features of such processes, some of the main challenges and obstacles that those processes involve, and possible ways of dealing with them.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

Prominent examples of systems are (i) the system of planets orbiting the sun or any other classical mechanical system, (ii) a hydrogen atom or any other quantum–mechanical system, and (iii) the earth's atmosphere or any other statistical mechanical system. We introduce a general and unified framework for describing such systems and show how it can be used to examine some familiar philosophical questions, including the following: how can we define nomological possibility, necessity, determinism, and indeterminism; what are symmetries and laws; what regularities must a system display to make scientific inference possible; how might principles of parsimony such as Occam's Razor help when we make such inferences; what is the role of space and time in a system; and might they be emergent features? Our framework is intended to serve as a toolbox for the formal analysis of systems that is applicable in several areas of philosophy.}

"The approach to social ontology that I advocate rejects the idea that a theory of social ontology is a pure effort of apriori philosophy that can be justified on non-empirical grounds. If it is stipulated (as Lauer (2009), Searle (2010), and Epstein (2015) appear to do) that social ontology is that area of pure philosophical reasoning that concerns itself with the nature of social entities, and we then ask if social ontology is prior to empirical reasoning or social-scientific methodology, then my response is that there is no intellectual or practical content to the field, and it has no relationship to social-science methodology whatsoever. Kant demonstrated the sterility of pure speculative metaphysics, and his program for synthetic-apriori knowledge of the world failed. So there is no scope for purely philosophical discovery that is relevant for knowledge of the empirical world. Only if there is a creative back-andforth between empirical investigation, theory formation, and ontological reflection will we gain knowledge and insight about the nature of the social world." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RCBNUUA?page=3}{Little 2020:15})
\par
"The theory of social ontology I wish to defend is not foundationalist in either a metaphysical or an epistemic sense. It does not, like Democritus, search for the smallest or simplest elements of the social realm and assert that all social phenomena are molecules composed of these elements. The goal of a theory of social ontology, on my view, is not like Euclid's theory of geometry—to arrive at a minimal conception of geometrical objects and a set of axioms defining their interactions, permitting derivation of all possible facts about space. I am confident that there is no finality or completeness in the field of social ontology. There is no hope for a final, conclusive, and complete theory of social reality that could serve as a basis for all social-science reasoning." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RCBNUUA?page=3}{Little 2020:15})
\par
"This anti-foundationalism in the area of metaphysics leads to skepticism about a phrase that Lauer uses frequently: "carving the social world at the joints." In my view, this is a conception that we are better off abandoning. The social realm does not have "joints."" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RCBNUUA?page=4}{Little 2020:16})
\par
"Rather, like Quine, I believe that ontological theorizing is of a piece with other kinds of scientific theorizing about an unobservable world, albeit at a fairly abstract extreme of that activity. So Lauer's realist version of social ontology fails, in my view, because it depends upon the idea that social ontology is a branch of apriori philosophy. Moreover, it assumes this is the only way we can make sense of realist ontological theorizing." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RCBNUUA?page=4}{Little 2020:16})
\par
"Fundamentally, the core of this position seems unassailable: there is no epistemic foundation possible outside the loose constraints of empirical observation and logic that can justify a set of beliefs about the fundamental structure of the world. There is no secret recipe for arriving at metaphysical knowledge through purely philosophical pathways." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RCBNUUA?page=6}{Little 2020:18})
\par
"There is another idea from Quine (1960) that is relevant for meta-theories of social ontology—the idea of underdetermination of theory by experience. In the social realm, this theory works out somewhat differently than in the realm of physics. When we consider the nature of the social world, we must begin somewhere, with some set of social phenomena in the center of our attention. And different starting points lead us as well to rather different ontological views of the social." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RCBNUUA?page=6}{Little 2020:18})
\par
"And how about what some would regard as the ultimate ontological disagreement about the social world, between individualists and holists, or between agent-centered and structure-centered theories? Do the holists and structuralists live in a different world from the agent-centered ontologists, economists, and game theorists? No. Both ontologies are descriptions of the same realities, but they proceed from different judgments about foreground and background." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RCBNUUA?page=7}{Little 2020:19})
\par
"ontological disagreements are just high-level scientific disagreements" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RCBNUUA?page=8}{Little 2020:20})
\par
"The difference between ontological statements and hypothetical theoretical statements is merely a matter of degrees—degree of abstractness, degree of generality, degree of distance from experimental and observational evidence" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RCBNUUA?page=8}{Little 2020:20})
\par
"We should not expect closure of ontological theory; we should not put our eggs in the "unity of scientific ontology" basket and hope for a definitive and final list of "what there is, socially speaking" in terms of which all social-science concepts can be reconstructed. The social world has enough heterogeneity, contingency, and plasticity to support a wide range of ontological ideas." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2RCBNUUA?page=9}{Little 2020:21})},

Departing from the successful reception of Vaisey (2009), we suggest that intradisciplinary debates in sociology regarding the merits of “dual process” formulations can benefit from a better understanding of the theoretical foundations of these models in cognitive and social psychology. We argue that the key is to distinguish the general DPF from more specific applications to particular domains, which we refer to as dual process models (DPMs). We show how different DPMs can be applied to a variety of analytically distinct issues of interest to cultural sociologists beyond specific issues related to morality, such as culture in learning, culture in memory, culture in thinking, and culture in acting processes. We close by outlining the implications of our argument for relevant work in cultural sociology.},

More substantively, we take on three canonical topics in cultural sociology: language, intersubjectivity, and associational links between elements, showing that the cognitive neurosciences can make conceptual and empirical contributions to the thinking of cultural sociologists in these areas.

  abstract = {I argue that although Ockham's Razor (OR) has its origins in a-priorist ontological mandates according to the purposes of natural theology and natural philosophy as influenced by it, the principle has taken on significant empirical and contingent materialist connotations and conceptual content since the scientific revolution. I briefly discuss the pluralism of the concept of OR historically and in contemporary science and philosophy. I then attempt to align scientific metaphysics with contemporary conceptions of OR, and to demonstrate that ontic parsimony is an indispensable element of scientific (contingent and anti-a-priorist) metaphysics. I then further deploy that scientific metaphysics to propose a contingently grounded semi-formal approach, with set theoretic features, and then with information theoretic features, to provide a way of assessing when a scientific theory and its ontology are aligned with OR appropriately in the context of the proposed scientific metaphysics.}

  abstract = {In the last few years, biologists and computer scientists have claimed that the introduction of data science techniques in molecular biology has changed the characteristics and the aims of typical outputs (i.e. models) of such a discipline. In this paper we will critically examine this claim. First, we identify the received view on models and their aims in molecular biology. Models in molecular biology are mechanistic and explanatory. Next, we identify the scope and aims of data science (machine learning in particular). These lie mainly in the creation of predictive models which performances increase as data set increases. Next, we will identify a tradeoff between predictive and explanatory performances by comparing the features of mechanistic and predictive models. Finally, we show how this a priori analysis of machine learning and mechanistic research applies to actual biological practice. This will be done by analyzing the publications of a consortium—The Cancer Genome Atlas—which stands at the forefront in integrating data science and molecular biology. The result will be that biologists have to deal with the tradeoff between explaining and predicting that we have identified, and hence the explanatory force of the 'new' biology is substantially diminished if compared to the 'old' biology. However, this aspect also emphasizes the existence of other research goals which make predictive force independent from explanation.}

In this article, I seek to clarify the grammar of Ihde's formalisms. Ihde's formalisms have not been the focus of scrutiny. Rather, they have largely been received in the literature as merely aphoristic or epigrammatical devices serving to clarify what can be explained in prose. My hypothesis is that Ihde's formalisms do not merely serve an epigrammatical function but rather admit of a generative grammar that extends his postphenomenological framework. I propose a notation that adheres to six rules of syntax that can be derived from Ihde's framework. I show that the proposed notation makes explicit the inter-relations among hidden dimensions of human–technology relations. Relying on my notation, I also suggest that the so-called cyborg turn is actually a turn away from the unharnessed syntax of Ihde's formalisms.}

It was confronted by a wide range of thinkers in the early nineteenth century, who brought to the understanding of social life a new perspective, in which collective phenomena were accorded priority in explanation.},

The money universal is not a social convention in David Lewis’s sense (while currencies and money particulars are characterized by high degrees of conventionality). The existence of the money universal is dependent on a larger institutional structure and cannot be understood in terms of collective belief or acceptance or agreement separately focusing on money.

First, a particular interpretation of the mathematical definition of information, known as the causal interpretation, is supported largely by misunderstandings of the engineering context from which it was taken. A better interpretation, which makes the definition and quantification of information relative to the function of its user, is outlined. The first half of the paper is given over to introducing communication theory and its competing interpretations. The second half explores three consequences of the main thesis. First, a popular claim that the quantification of information in a signal is irrelevant for the meaning of that signal is exposed as fallacious. Second, a popular distinction between causal and semantic information is shown to be misleading, and I argue it should be replaced with a related distinction between natural and intentional signs. Finally, I argue that recent empirical work from microbiology and cognitive science drawing on resources of mathematical communication theory is best interpreted by the functional account. Overall, a functional approach is shown to be both theoretically and empirically well-supported.},

Active inference, whose most famous tenet is the free energy principle, has inspired excitement and confusion in equal measure. Here, we lay the ground for proper critical analysis of active inference, in three ways. First, we give simplified versions of its core mathematical models. Second, we outline the historical development of active inference and its relationship to other theoretical approaches. Third, we describe three different kinds of claim—labelled mathematical, empirical and general—routinely made by proponents of the framework, and suggest dialectical links between them. Overall, we aim to increase philosophical understanding of active inference so that it may be more readily evaluated.

«Our simplified models of the free energy principle are scientific models. They in turn posit generative models, possessed by agents and employed by them to perform inference and action.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 2)
\par
«In each of our scientific models, the generative model in question takes the form of a joint probability distribution like p(w, x) or p(w, x, z) .» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 2)
\par
«The table describes a joint probability distribution p(w, x), where w ranges over possible cat locations: w ∈\{kitchen, bedroom\}, and x ranges over possible cat sounds: x ∈\{meow, purr\}.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 3) \$p(w, x)\$ in free energy equations. \$w\$ and \$x\$ are sets of possible values
\par
«This learning task is relatively difficult. It should be distinguished from the simpler task of estimating w from an observation of x , which is called inference» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 5)
\par
«When this problem is formulated by statisticians, we usually begin with a set of possible distributions q, and search for the member of that set which lies as close to p(w x) as possible. We can do this indirectly by using a measure of inaccuracy. Active inference employs a measure of inaccuracy called variational free energy, labelled F. Because it is a measure of inaccuracy, smaller values are better than larger values. Given a set of candidate distributions q, the best is the one that produces the lowest value of F. Although the lowest possible value of F is given by the true posterior p(w x) , that might not be one of the available distributions q. In that case, the optimal q is the member of the set that yields the lowest value of F from among the available members.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 5)
\par
«Variational free energy captures two sources of inaccuracy in belief and dictates how they ought to be traded off against one another. The two sources of inaccuracy are overfitting and failing to explain the data.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 5)
\par
«Overfitting. According to lexico.com (2021), overfitting is “The production of an analysis which corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably.”» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 5)
\par
«You overfit when you choose a distribution q(w) that explains the current data very well, but fails to account for the wider range of statistical possibilities encapsulated by p(w)» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 6)
\par
«The cost of overfitting can therefore be measured by checking how far q(w) diverges from p(w) . The first term of F is a measure of this kind: This term, which is also called relative entropy or Kullback-Leibler divergence, measures how far a distribution q(w) differs from a distribution p(w).3 When q and p are identical, they coincide for every value of the sum. In this case the logarithm is always zero (because log a a = 0 ) so the total value of the sum is zero. As q and p get more and more different, the total value of the term increases. To avoid overfitting, q(w) should be close to p(w).» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 6)
\par
«Failing to explain the data. Mathematically, ‘explaining the data’ means assigning high probability to events w that make the probability of x high. The penalty for failing to explain data is captured by the second term of F:» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 6)
\par
«Variational free energy F is the sum of the penalties for overfitting and failing to explain the data:» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 6)
\par
«w q(w) log q(w) p(w)» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 6)
\par
«w q(w) log 1 p(x w)» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 6)
\par
«F(p, q, x)= w q(w) log q(w) p(w) Penalty for overfitting + w q(w) log 1 p(x w) Penalty for failing to explain the data» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 6)
\par
«We set up the inference problem by saying that the agent knows the statistics p(w, x) , but might not have access to the marginal distribution p(x) . The agent was prohibited from following Bayesian PrinciPle for this reason. However, we did not address whether the agent has access to the prior p(w) or the likelihood p(x w). Since F includes both those terms, one would expect the agent needs them in order to use F to guide inference. As it turns out, the agent does not need access to the prior or the likelihood, because (4) simplifies to:» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 7)
\par
«Given our assumptions so far, the agent has access to all three inputs to F in Eq. (5): • p: A joint distribution over w and x . The agent’s generative model and, in this simple example, also the true general statistical connection between w and x. • q: A distribution over w . The agent’s credences about the unobservable state, in light of observing a specific piece of data x. • x : A value of a random variable. The specific piece of data the agent has just observed.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 7)
\par
«Free energy PrinciPle (inFerence): q(w) ← � argmin q F Here argmin q means ‘choose the distribution q that makes the following term as small as possible’.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 7)
\par
«Notice that the form of Free energy PrinciPle (inFerence) is the same as that of Bayesian PrinciPle. In both cases you are told to perform a calculation and set q(w) equal to the resulting value. The difference is that Bayesian PrinciPle counsels a direct calculation via Bayes’ theorem. In contrast, Free energy PrinciPle (inFerence) counsels what might be called an indirect calculation. You must assess candidate distributions q in order to find the one that produces the lowest value of F.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 7)
\par
«F(p, q, x)= w q(w) log q(w) p(w, x)» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 7) Simplified version of the previous equation
\par
«n the active inference literature, the penalty for overfitting is often labelled ‘complexity’. The penalty for failing to explain the data is usually presented as a reward for explaining the data well; it is therefore introduced as the negation of the term we use here, and is called ‘accuracy’. Consequently, variational free energy is defined as the difference between complexity and accuracy. The goal of inference is described as minimizing complexity while maximizing accuracy. Our presentation is mathematically equivalent.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 7)
\par
«One of the potentially confusing aspects of active inference is that it treats the statistical model p as a measure of both probabilities and preferences at the same time. Later we will discuss possible justifications of this move; for now we assume it is interpretatively valid, in order to give as smooth an exposition as possible.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 9)
\par
«Recall that Free energy PrinciPle (inFerence) counsels choosing beliefs by minimising a function that measures the cost of inaccuracy. That function, F , is a sum of two kinds of penalty. Action selection is governed in the same way, but with a slightly different cost function called expected free energy and labelled G. The definition of G is closely related to that of F. The interpretation of the two penalty terms changes as the formalism is updated to reflect the fact we are now making measurements over expected future states. Since future states have yet to be observed, the agent must average over them to obtain expected values. The penalties are associated with failing to satisfy preferences and failing to minimize future surprise.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 9)
\par
«Failing to satisfy preferences. q(w z) is the assumed distribution over hidden states given our action. If we place the cat in the bedroom, where do we expect it to be? p(w) is now a preference distribution over hidden states. The first penalty term in G is a measure of how far the expected distribution of hidden states diverges from the preference distribution:» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 9)
\par
«w q(w z) log q(w z) p(w)» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 9)
\par
«Failing to minimize future surprise. One of the tenets of active inference is that agents should act to ensure that future data are not too surprising. The second penalty term of G therefore measures how surprising future data would be, on average, if you performed z:» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 10)
\par
«Overall, expected free energy is a sum of these penalties:» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 10)
\par
«Free energy PrinciPle (action): z ← � argmin z G» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 10)
\par
«w q(w z) x p(x w) log 1 p(x w)» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 10)
\par
«G(p, q, z)= w q(w z) log q(w z) p(w) Penalty for failing to satisfy your preferences + w q(w z) x p(x w) log 1 p(x w) Penalty for failing to minimize expected surprise of future data» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 10)
\par
«There are at least two reasons why this interpretation should be distinguished from utilities as decision theory traditionally understands them. First, you should not simply prefer that your cat always be the temperature that happens to occur most often according to the frequency distribution. Healthy functioning entails some fluctuation of temperatures throughout the day. The goal is not to maximise the value of this distribution, but to match future event frequencies to it. Second, preferences are just one consideration that must be taken into account when choosing actions. The preference penalty must be balanced against the surprise penalty.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 11)
\par
«One of the ways proponents of the framework turn this unusual interpretation to their advantage is by casting action as a form of inference: The mechanism underlying [minimizing expected free energy] is formally symmetric to perceptual inference, i.e., rather than inferring the cause of sensory data an organism must infer actions that best make sensory data accord with an internal representation of the environment. Buckley et~al. (2017: p.57), emphasis added» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 12)
\par
«By starting with an inference problem in the form of expected free energy minimization, preferences emerge as the first term of Eq. (8). But attempting to achieve these preferences must be balanced against the second term, which explicitly counsels minimizing future surprise.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 12)

«(Pearl 1988). Roughly, in Pearl’s sense the ‘Markov blanket’ of a focal node is the set of nodes that provide total information about the focal node. However, Markov blankets have taken on a special usage within active inference (Bruineberg et~al. 2021). In the sense required here, a Markov blanket can be understood as the set of nodes that ‘screen off’ the agent from nodes considered external to it.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 13)

«The correspondence between high values of F and life-threatening states leads to a third form of the free energy principle: Free energy PrinciPle (selection): any system that survives long enough will act so as to appear to be minimizing F.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 14)
\par
«In recent work Friston gives a deflationary interpretation on which agents do not in fact minimize anything, but perform acts which can be interpreted as minimizing F.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 14)
\par
«Free energy PrinciPle (selection) interprets p as a kind of fitness function in the form of a probability distribution over sensory states. When we measured the temperature of our cat, we obtained a frequency distribution that acted both as a description of what happened when the cat was previously healthy and as a prescription of what temperatures the cat should have if we want it to remain healthy. Free energy PrinciPle (selection) expands the scope of this basic idea, from cats to every biological system, and from temperature to every measurable property.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 15)
\par
«energy PrinciPle (selection) captures the rather banal point that systems can only ever occupy survivable states. If you are likely to be in states your successful ancestors were in, then you are likely to be successful. This trivial observation is reflected mathematically by the fact that variational free energy contains a reciprocal of p(w, x) : high values of p(w, x) therefore produce low values of F . Indeed, any function that contains this reciprocal (or its logarithm) as a component will be infinite when the probability is zero.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 16)
\par
«It is easy to show that variational free energy is an upper bound on surprisal.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 16)
\par
«roof: rearranging (4) gives F = ∑ w q(w) log q(w) p(w�x) + log 1 p(x) . The first term is a relative entropy, which by Jensen’s inequality is always greater than or equal to zero (Cover and Thomas 2006,~p. 28). Therefore F ≥ log 1 p(x) .» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 16)
\par
«minimizing variational free energy is not the only way to minimize surprise. Any non-negative function added to surprisal is an upper bound on surprisal. Proponents need another premise that singles out variational free energy as the function organisms should be treated as minimizing.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 17)
\par
«In our first model, p was a generative model employed by an agent. It was therefore interpreted as representing probabilities. 2. In our second model, in addition to representing probabilities, p measured the desirability of certain future states over others. It was therefore interpreted as representing preferences. 3. In our third model, p tallied the historical frequencies of a set of (hypothetical) ancestors. It was therefore interpreted as representing the fitness of different states.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 17)
\par
«Supporters of the framework often point to the third role to explain how p can simultaneously fulfil the first two. A historical tally of successful states denotes probabilities (i.e. ancestral frequencies) and preferences (i.e. future expected fitness).» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 17)
\par
«Entities that employ representations to act successfully are distinct in important ways from entities that can be treated as if they employ representations as a consequence of the effects of physical laws.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 17)
\par
«Sprevak (2020, Sect.~6.3) convincingly argues that Friston invokes two distinct senses of free energy, which here correspond roughly to roles 1 and 3. Sprevak cites Colombo and Wright (2018) as drawing a similar distinction. Williams (2021) distinguishes descriptive and explanatory versions of the free energy principle, seemingly tracking the same issue.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 17) {$>$} Friston uses the concept of free energy in at least two senses: probabilities and fitness function.
\par
«We also assumed that there was a single cause, w , of sensory data. Realistically, the external world is a panoply of criss-crossing causal paths. An adequate generative model would contain terms representing at least some of the interactions between unobservable states. Active inference captures these features by treating agents as employing hierarchical models of their external worlds. The first level of the hierarchy x is the sensory data, the second level w1 represents whatever causes sensory data, the third level w2 represents whatever causes w1 , and so on.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 18) {$>$} Hierarchical evolutionary model of convention formation? — [[@hawkins2021]] + https://probmods.org/
\par
«In principle, agents could be uncertain about any aspect of their representation of the world, so every model component can be subject to updating in light of evidence.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 18)
\par
«Regarding action, instead of a single act z the framework enables decisions about sequences of acts. Such sequences are called policies and are usually labelled 𝜋. Expected free energy can be calculated across an entire policy in order to determine which sequence of acts is optimal.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 18)
\par
«most successful neural models were perhaps those spawned by the predictive processing tradition. Predictive processing was inspired by predictive coding, a technique in communications engineering (Elias 1955). In the 1980s and 1990s neuroscientists began investigating its plausibility as a model of visual perception (Kawato et~al. 1993; Rao and Ballard 1999; Srinivasan et~al. 1982). In the early 2000s, Friston (2002,~p. 131) claimed that a predictive processing system could be constructed that performs variational inference (see also Friston 2003,~pp. 1339–1340).» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 20)
\par
«Very roughly, we can understand the relationship between these aspects in terms of Marr’s hierarchy, which is usually said to have three levels: computational, algorithmic, and implementational (Marr 1982). In Friston’s scientific model of predictive processing, the computation is variational inference. The algorithm is the expectation-maximisation algorithm, a two-step process whereby two different mathematical operations are performed iteratively. Neal and Hinton (1998) had already shown that a version of that algorithm minimizes variational free energy. Friston claimed the algorithm could be implemented by the activities of (and structural relations between) individual neurons (for a simplified example see Bogacz 2017, Sect.~2–3).» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 20)
\par
«he claim that a small neural network is capable of minimizing variational free energy via encoding prediction error is verifiable by actually building such a network, as Bogacz (2017, Sect.~2–3) shows.» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 23)
\par
«The FEP is a mathematical formulation that explains, from first principles, the characteristics of biological systems that are able to resist decay and persist over time. It rests on the idea that all biological systems instantiate a hierarchical generative model of the world that implicitly minimises its internal entropy by minimising free energy. Ramstead et~al. (2018,~p. 2)» (Mann и др., 2022, p. 30)},

In this paper, we relate the principle to a framework that philosophers of biology are familiar with: Ruth Millikan’s teleosemantics. We argue that: (i) systems that minimise free energy are systems with a proper function; and (ii) Karl Friston’s notion of implicit modelling can be understood in terms of Millikan’s notion of mapping relations. Our analysis reveals some surprising formal similarities between the two frameworks, and suggests interesting lines of future research. We hope this will aid further philosophical evaluation of the free energy principle.},

«A 'strategy' is a behavioural phenotype; i.e. it is a specification ofwhat an individual will do in any situation in which it may find itself. An ESS is a strategy such that, if all the members ofa population adopt it, then no mutant strategy could invade the population under the influence of natural selection. The concept is couched in terms of a 'strategy' because it arose in the context of animal behaviour. The idea, however, can be applied equally well to any kind of phenotypic variation, and the word strategy could be replaced by the word phenotype; for example, a strategy could be the growth fo rm ofa plant, or the age at first reproduction, or the relative numbers of sons and daughters produced by a parent.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 11)
\par
«The essential features of this model are that the population is infinite, that reproduction is asexual, and that pairwise contests take place between two opponents, which do not differ in any way discernible to themselves before the contest starts (i.e. 'symmetric' contests). It is also assumed that there is a finite set of alternative strategies, so that the game can be expressed in matrix form» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 11) {$>$} The assumptions of HDB game

«By 'value', I mean that the Darwinian fitness of an individual obtaining the resource would be increased by V.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 11) {$>$} \$V\$ in HDB game model means "value".

«Now imagine an infinite population ofindividuals, each adopting the strategy H or D, pairing off at random. Before the contest, all individuals have a fitness Woo Let p = frequency of H strategists in the population, and W(H), We D) = fitness of Hand D strategists respectively, E(H,D) = payoff to individual adopting H against a D opponent (and a similar notation for other strategy pairs). Then if each individual engages in one contest, W(H) = Wo +p E(H,H)+(l-p) E(H,D), \vphantom\{\} WeD) = Wo +p E(D,H)+(l -p) E(D,D). (2. 1)» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 12) {$>$} Fitness value of each strategy
\par
«If I isa stable strategy,* it must have the property that, if almost all members of the population adopt I, then the fitness of these typical members is greater than that of any possible mutant; otherwise, the mutant could invade the population, and I would not be stable. Thus consider a population consisting mainly ofI, with a small frequency p of some mutant J. Then, as in (2. 1), WeI) = Wo +(1-p) E(I,I) + p E(/J ), \vphantom\{\} W(J ) = Wo +(1-p) E(J,I) +p E(J,J). (2.3) Since I is stable, W(I) {$>$} W( 1). Si,nce p � 1, this requires, for all J \# I, either E(/,I) {$>$} E(J,! ) or E(I,I) = E(J,! ) and E(I,1 ) {$>$} E(J,J). (2. 4 a) (2. 4 b) These conditions were given by Maynard Smith \& Price (1973). Any strategy satisfying (2. 4) is an 'evolutionarily stable strategy', or ESS, as defined at the beginning of this chapter. Conditions (2. 4 a, b) will be referred to as the 'standard conditions' for an ESS, but it should be clear that they apply only to the particular model just described, with an infinite population, asexual inheritance and pairwise contests.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 13) {$>$} The 'standard conditions' for ESS hold **only** for models with infinite population, asexual inheritance and pairwise contests.
\par
«But what if V {$<$} C? Neither H nor D is an ESS. We can proceed in two ways. We could ask: what would happen to a population of Hawks and Doves? I shall return to this question later in this chapter, but first I wa nt to ask what will happen if an individual can play sometimes H and sometimes D. Thus let strategy Ibe defined as 'play H with probability P, and D with probability (1 - P),; when an individual reproduces, it transmits to its offspring, not H or D, but the probability P of playing H.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 13)
\par
«Such a strategy I, which chooses randomly from a set of possible actions, is called a 'mixed' strategy; this contrasts with a 'pure' strategy, such as Hawk, which contains no stochastic element. Is there a value of P such that I isan ESS? To answer this question, we make use of a theorem proved by Bishop \& Cannings (1978), which states: If I is a mixed ESS which includes, with non-zero probability, the pure strategies A,B,C, ..., then E(A,I) = E(B,I) = E(C,! ) ... = E(I,I) . The reason for this can be seen intuitively as fo llows. If E(A,I){$>$} E(B,I) then surely it would pay toadopt A more often andB less often. If so, then I would not be an ESS. Hence, if I isan ESS, the expected payoffs to the various strategies composing I mustbe equal.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 13)
\par
«Its importance in the present context is that, ifthere is a value P which makes I anESS ofthe Hawk-Dove game, we can find it by solving the equation E(H,I) = E(D,I), therefore P E(H,H )+(1-P)E(H,D) = PE(D,H)+(1-P) E(D,D), (2.5» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 13)
\par
«16 The basic model therefore !(V-C)P+V(1 -P) = !V( 1-P), or P = VI C. More generally, fo r the matrix: JJ Jab Je d, (2.6) there is a mixed ESS if a {$<$} c and d {$<$} b, the ESS being to adopt I with probability (b -d) P=( -b- + c-a --d)�' (2.7) If there is an ESS ofthe fo rm I = PH+ (1- P)D, then P is given by equation (2.6). We still have to prove, however, that I satisfies equations (2.4b). Thus E(H,!) = E(D,!) = E(I,!), and therefore stability requires that E(/, D) {$>$} E(D,D) and E(/,H) {$>$} E(H,H). To check this: E( /,D) = PV+ !(1 - P)V {$>$} E(D,D). and E( l,H) = !P(V- C) {$>$} E(H,H), since V {$<$} C. Thus we have shown that, when V {$<$} C, a mixed strategy with P= VI C is evolutionarily stable. The first conclusion from our model, then, is that, in contests in which the cost ofinjury is high relative to the rewards ofvictory, we expect to find mixed strategies. The model is so oversimplified that the conclusion must be treated with reserve.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 14)
\par
«At equilibrium, the fitnesses W(H) and WeD) must be equal. That is pE(H,H) +(1-p)E(H,D) = pE(D,H)+(1-p )E(D,D). (2.8) Equation (2.8) is identical to equation (2.5), with p replacing P. Thus if P gives the frequency of H in a mixed ESS, and p the frequency of H in a population at genetic equilibrium, then p = P. This conclusion holds also ifthere are more than two pure strategies.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 14) {$>$} Fitness values are equal at equilibrium
\par
«Suppose now that we introduce a third strategy, R or 'Retaliator'. R behaves lik� a Dove against another Dove, but, if its opponent escalates, R escalates also and acts like a Hawk. The payoff matrix is shown in Table 2a.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 14)
\par
«The matrix in Table 2a is awkward to analyse because, in the absence of Hawk, D and R are identical. It is shown in Appendix E that the only ESS is the mixed strategy, I =tH +tD.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 15)
\par
«The payoff matrix in Table 2b may be more realistic; it assumes that, in a contest between D and R; the -Retaliator does, at least occasionally, discover that its opponent is unwilling to escalate, and takes advantage of this, so that, in D v. R contests, R does a little better and D a little worse. It is easy to see that R is now an ESS, because E(R,R ) is greater than either E(D,R ) or E(H,R ). Hence neither D nor H, nor any mixture of the two, could invade an R population. In general, if any entry on the diagonal of a payoffmatrix is greater than all other entries in the same column, then the corresponding pure strategy is an ESS. But is there any other ESS? In particular, what of I =tH +tD? Following the usual rules: E(H,!) = -t+t02 = t, E(D,! ) = toO +t = t, and hence E(I,! ) =t. Note that, as required of a mixed ESS, E(H,! ) = F;.(D,! ) . E(R,! ) = -t+ 1·1 x t = 0.05. The matrix in Table 2b, then, has two ESS's, I= tH +tD and R. A population could evolve to either, depending on its initial compo­ sition.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 15)

(b) Flows for the H-D-R game given in Table 2. There are attractors at I and R and a saddle point at S.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 15)
\par
«Of course, such a diagram can only represent the frequencies of the three pure strategies in a polymorphic population. In this case, however, there is a correspondence between the stable states of the polymorphic population and the stable strategies when mixed strategies are possible. Thus there are two stable states: pure R, and a polymorphism with equal frequencies of Hand D, the latter corresponding to the mixed ESS, I= tH + tD.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 15)
\par
«A game with only two pure strategies always has at least one ESS (Appendix B); but ifthere are three ormorepure strategies, there may be no ESS.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 15)
\par
«The Hawk-Dove game analysed above is symmetrical. That is to say, the two contestants start in identical situations: they have the same choice of strategies and the same prospective payoffs. There may be a difference in size or strength between them, which would influence the outcome of an escalated contest, but if so it is not known to the contestants and therefore cannot affect their choice of strategies. Most actual contests, however, are asymmetric. They may be between a male and a female, between an old and young, or a small and large individual, or between the owner of a resource and a non-owner. An asymmetry may be perceived beforehand by the contestants; if so, it can and usually will influence the choice of action. This is most obviously so if the asymmetry alters the payoffs, or affects the likely outcome of an escalated contest. It is equally true, although less obvious, that an asymmetry which does not alter either payoffs or success in escalation can determine the choice of action. Table 4. The Hawk-Dove-Bourgeois game H D B H -1 o -0.5 D 2 1 1.5 B 1.0 Thus, consider a contest between the owner of a territory and an intruder. In practice, the value of the territory may be greater to the owner because of learnt local knowledge, and it is also possible that ownership confers an advantage in an escalated contest. For simplicity, however, I shall ignore these effects. Let us introduce into the Hawk-Dove game a third strategy, B or 'Bourgeois'; i.e. 'if owner, play Hawk; if intruder, play Dove'. The payoff matrix is shown in Table 4 . Note that it is always the case, when two B strategists meet, that one is the owner and the other intruder. I have assumed in filling in An extended model 23 the matrix that each strategy type is owner and intruder equally frequently. That is, genes determining behaviour are independent of the factors, genetic or environmental, determining ownership. It is clear that B is an ESS, and easy to check that it is theonly ESS of this game� Thus an asymmetry of ownership will be used as a conventional one to settle the contest, even when ownership alters neither the payoffs nor success in fighting. The same is true of any other asymmetry, provided it is unambiguously perceived by both contestants.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 17) {$>$} 'Bourgeois' is the only ESS of the HDB game, and it uses an asymmetry of ownership to settle the contest conventionally, even when ownership alters neither payoffs nor success in fighting.
\par
«The role may influence the chances ofwinning anescalated contest, or the value of winning.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 53)
\par
«We now make the crucial assumption that the probability that an individual occupies a particular role is independent of its strategy. This is equivalent to assuming that there is no pleiotropism or linkage disequilibrium between the genes influencing whether an individual is an owner and the genes influencing its strategy. Of course, fo r a strategy such as B, the role of an individual is correlated with the particular action, Hawk or Dove, adopted; the assumption is that the strategy B itself is not correlated with role.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 53) {$>$} According to @maynardsmith1982, the role of an agent, e.g. 'owner', 'intruder' or 'older', is uncorrelated with her strategy, e.g. 'Hawk', 'Dove', or 'Bourgeois'. If an agent is an 'owner', it does not entail that she always plays a certain 'owner' strategy like 'Hawk' or 'Bourgeois'. However, according to @gintis2007a, empirical findings corroborate the existence of the 'endowment' effect, when owners value resource more than intruders, thus making them fight harder for it. It presupposes a certain degree of correlation between role and strategy.
\par
«Given independence between roles and strategies, the payoff matrix is shown in Table 12. In deriving the matrix, note that: (a) The B strategist chooses Hand D with equal frequencies, because it is an owner on half the occasions and an intruder on half. (b) In contests between two B's, if one chooses H then the other chooses D. If v{$>$} C, the only ESS is H; ifit is worth risking injury to gain the resource, ownership will be ignored. The more interesting case is V {$<$} C. Then the only ESS is B; ownership settles the contest without escalation.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 53)
\par
«The conclusion does not depend on the value of the resource, or the chance of victory, being different fo r owner and intruder. Maynard Smith \& Parker (1976) used the phrase 'uncorrelated asymmetry' to refer to such contests.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 53)
\par
«The assumption that the payoffs to owner and intruder are equal, which is made in deriving Table 12(p. 96), is often unrealistic. Thus the value of a territory may be greater to an owner, who has already learnt about the distribution of fo od, refuges, etc. In some cases ownership may confer advantages in an escalated contest. Inequality of payoffs is also likely for other types of asymmetry, for example, of size or age. Inequality ofpayoffs is not necessary if anasymmetry is to settle contests (although this conclusion will be modified later, when discussing the asymmetric war of attrition). If, however, inequalities of payoff do exist, they can influence outcomes.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 56)
\par
«if we start from a population of animals which ignore the asymmetry, and therefore adopt the mixed strategy M (or, perhaps, reach the corresponding genetic polymorphism), a B mutant could invade, leading to the evolution ofthe common-sense ESS, but there is no way in which the paradoxical ESS could be reached, even ifit is stable.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 57)
\par
«To summarise, asymmetric games of the Hawk-Dove type, with a finite set ofdiscrete possible pure strategies, can have both common­ sense and paradoxical ESS's, but only a mutant adopting the fo rmer strategy can invade a population whose members ignore the asym­ metry and adopt the appropriate mixed strategy. Asymmetric games of the war of attrition type, with a continuously distributed set of possible actions, can be analysed if one assumes that errors in role identification occur. Ifso, and ifpayoffs in the two roles are unequal, only the common-sense ESS exists; that is, the contestant to whom the value ofwinning is greater wins, and the other contestant gives in cheaply.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 58)
\par
«In conclusion, there is at least one kind ofgame which people play, but which seems beyond the capacity of animals. This is the 'social contract' game. Thus suppose that some pattern of behaviour - for example theft - is seen to be undesirable. A group of individuals capable of symbolic communication can agree not to steal, and to punish any member ofthe group who does steal. That, by itself, is not sufficient to guarantee stability, because the act of punishing is presumably costly, and therefore individuals would be tempted to accept the benefits of the contract but not the costs of enforcing it. Stability requires that refusal by an individual to participate in enforcing the contract should also be regarded as a breach which will be punished. At a later stage, enforcement is entrusted to a subgroup, who are rewarded for carrying it out.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 92) {$>$} @maynardsmith1982 considers the 'social contract' game to be unique for humans. That is, to define behavioral rules and sanction for their violation.
\par
«An 'asymmetric' contest is one in which there is a difference in 'role' between the contestants, of a kind which enables either ofthem to adopt a strategy 'in role 1, do A; in role 2, do B'. Clearly, roles must be perceived by the contestants; otherwise, they could not affect behaviour. Examples are male and female, or ownerand intruder. It is assumedthat the circumstances, genetic or environmental, which deci4e in which role an individual finds itself, act independently of genes determining its strategy.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 108)
\par
«A 'symmetric' contest is one with no role differentiation.» (Maynard Smith, 1982, p. 108)},

This paper extends Mayo-Wilson's results to cases in which {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}experimental{$<$}/em{$>$} data is available. I prove several new theorems that show that, as the number of variables under investigation grows, experiments do not improve, in the worst-case, one's ability to identify the true causal model if one can measure only a few variables at a time. However, stronger statistical assumptions (e.g., Gaussianity) significantly aid causal discovery in piecemeal inquiry, even if such assumptions are unhelpful when all variables can be measured simultaneously.}

  abstract = {According to Relevance Theory, pragmatic interpretation is guided by an expectation of (optimal) relevance. This expectation is constrained by considerations about the speaker’s mental states. In this paper I address a recent criticism against Relevance Theory put forth by Mazzone (2009, 2013). This criticism focuses on a core notion within the relevance-theoretic framework, that is, the notion of ‘optimal relevance’ and its role as a pragmatic criterion of acceptability. Mazzone suggests that the appeal to the notion of ‘optimal relevance’ is not enough to show how information about the speaker’s mental states (e.g., her knowledge and beliefs) affects on-line pragmatic processing. I develop a tentative line of solution to cognitively implement the notion of ‘optimal relevance’. My proposal is grounded on the interaction between the comprehension module and epistemic vigilance mechanisms, that is, those mechanisms which check the quality of incoming information and the reliability of the individual who dispenses it (Sperber et al., 2010).},

His theory also implicates concepts and issues of foundational interest to sociologists, including social structure, institutional differentiation and the relationship between linguistic performativity and institutional reality. Despite this overlap with sociological theory, and despite some sustained attention from sociologists (e.g., Lukes, ), no formal theoretical model of Searle's work exists within sociology. This paper reviews the core concepts of Searle's theory before concisely describing and then formally modelling their propositional structure. Though the overlap of Searle's approach with classical and contemporary sociological theory is discussed throughout, the paper concludes with a specific argument about his proper assimilation into sociological theory vis-à-vis Durkheim, Bourdieu and Giddens.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a mathematical model of an iterated, asymmetric Hawk-Dove game with the novel feature that not only are successive pairs of interactants — in the roles of owner and intruder contesting a site — drawn randomly from the population, but also the behaviour adopted at one interaction affects the role of a contestant in the next. Under the assumption that a site is essential for reproduction, the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) of the population is found to depend on the probability, w, that the game will continue for at least a further period (which is inversely related to predation risk), and five other parameters; two of them are measures of site scarcity, two are measures of fighting costs, and the last is a measure of resource holding potential (RHP). Among the four strategies — Hawk (H), Dove (D), Bourgeois (B) and anti-Bourgeois (X) — only D is incapable of being an ESS; and regions of parameter space are found in which the ESS can be only H, or only X, or only B; or either H or X; or either X or B; or either H or B; or any of the three. The scarcer the sites or the lower the costs of fighting, or the lower the value of w, the more likely it is that H is an ESS; the more abundant the sites or the higher the costs of fighting, or the higher the value of w, the more likely it is that X or B is an ESS. The different ESSs are interpreted as different ecotypes. The analysis suggests how a non-fighting population could evolve from a fighting population under decreasing risk of predation. If there were no RHP, or if RHP were low, then the ESS in the non-fighting population would be X; only if RHP were sufficiently high would the ESS be B, and the scarcer the sites, the higher the RHP would have to be. These conclusions support the thesis that if long-term territories are essential for reproduction and sites are scarce, then ownership is ruled out not only as an uncorrelated asymmetry for settling disputes in favour of owner, but also as a correlated asymmetry.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we evaluate the proposal that a central function of commitments within joint action is to reduce various kinds of uncertainty, and that this accounts for the prevalence of commitments in joint action. While this idea is prima facie attractive, we argue that it faces two serious problems. First, commitments can only reduce uncertainty if they are credible, and accounting for the credibility of commitments proves not to be straightforward. Second, there are many other ways in which uncertainty is commonly reduced within joint actions, which raises the possibility that commitments may be superfluous. Nevertheless, we argue that the existence of these alternative uncertainty reduction processes does not make commitments superfluous after all but, rather, helps to explain how commitments may contribute in various ways to uncertainty reduction.},

  abstract = {Dual-process models are increasingly popular in sociology as a framework for theorizing the role of automatic cognition in shaping social behavior. However, empirical studies using dual-process models often rely on ad hoc measures such as forced-choice surveys, observation, and interviews whose relationships to underlying cognitive processes are not fully established. In this article, we advance dual-process research in sociology by (1) proposing criteria for measuring automatic cognition, and (2) assessing the empirical performance of two popular measures of automatic cognition developed by psychologists. We compare the ability of the Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT), the Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP), and traditional forced-choice measures to predict process-pure estimates of automatic influences on individuals’ behavior during a survey task. Results from three studies focusing on politics, morality, and racial attitudes suggest the AMP provides the most valid and consistent measure of automatic cognitive processes. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for sociological practice.},

While these wide accounts override traditional methodological individualism, the study of cognition has already progressed beyond these proposed perspectives towards building integrated explanations of the mechanisms involved, including not only internal submechanisms but also interactions with others, groups, cognitive artifacts, and their environment. The claim is substantiated with reference to recent developments in the study of “mindreading” and debates on emotions. We claim that the current practice in cognitive (neuro)science has undergone, in effect, a silent mechanistic revolution, and has turned from initial binary oppositions and abstract proposals towards the integration of wide perspectives with the rest of the cognitive (neuro)sciences.},

  abstract = {Many different things are said to have meaning: people mean to do various things; tools and other artifacts are meant for various things; people mean various things by using words and sentences; natural signs mean things; representations in people's minds also presumably mean things. In Varieties of Meaning, Ruth Garrett Millikan argues that these different kinds of meaning can be understood only in relation to each other.What does meaning in the sense of purpose (when something is said to be meant for something) have to do with meaning in the sense of representing or signifying? Millikan argues that the explicit human purposes, explicit human intentions, are represented purposes. They do not merely represent purposes; they possess the purposes that they represent. She argues further that things that signify, intentional signs such as sentences, are distinguished from natural signs by having purpose essentially; therefore, unlike natural signs, intentional signs can misrepresent or be false.Part I discusses Purposes and Cross-Purposes -- what purposes are, the purposes of people, of their behaviors, of their body parts, of their artifacts, and of the signs they use. Part II then describes a previously unrecognized kind of natural sign, locally recurrent natural signs, and several varieties of intentional signs, and discusses the ways in which representations themselves are represented. Part III offers a novel interpretation of the way language is understood and of the relation between semantics and pragmatics. Part IV discusses perception and thought, exploring stages in the development of inner representations, from the simplest organisms whose behavior is governed by perception-action cycles to the perceptions and intentional attitudes of humans.},

  abstract = {The essay, based also on unpublished writings, analytically reconstructs the Italian debate concerning the problem of historical epistemology and of the different relationships that can be established between epistemological reflection and the history of science. We start from awareness, à la Lakatos, that a "history of science without philosophy of science is blind, while a philosophy of science without the history of science is empty". However, during the twentieth century Italian different theoretical positions emerged. Giulio Preti began by underlining how the history of science should be understood as the history of scientific thought. This position was close to that expressed by Giovanni Gentile for whom the history of science had to be reduced to the history of philosophy. Against this neo-realist claim, an epistemologist like Ludovico Geymonat reacted by underlining how science has its own history as a science. The critical debate between Preti and Geymonat has finally led the first to underline how the history of science must then be articulated in different conceptual traditions, while the latter ended up sharing the need to study the history of science as a history of scientific thought.}

To date, research on the antecedents and consequences of punishment has largely relied upon agent-based modeling and laboratory experiments. Here, we report a longitudinal study documenting punishment responses to norm violations in daily life (               k               \,=\,1507;               N               \,=\,257) and test pre-registered hypotheses about the antecedents of direct punishment (i.e., confrontation) and indirect punishment (i.e., gossip and social exclusion). We find that people use confrontation versus gossip in a context-sensitive manner. Confrontation is more likely when punishers have been personally victimized, have more power, and value offenders more. Gossip is more likely when norm violations are severe and when punishers have less power, value offenders less, and experience disgust. Findings reveal a complex punishment psychology that weighs the benefits of adjusting others’ behavior against the risks of retaliation.},

Nevertheless, philosophers working within this dichotomy pay little attention to the way in which mathematics evolves and structures itself. Focusing on mathematical practice, I propose a weak notion of objectivity of mathematical knowledge that preserves the intersubjective character of mathematical knowledge but does not bear on a view of mathematics as a body of mind-independent necessary truths. Furthermore, I show how that the successful application of mathematics in science is an important trigger for the objectivity of mathematical knowledge.}

A satisfactory account for the evolutionary dynamics of social norms, therefore, has to link individual beliefs and expectations to population-level dynamics, where individual norms change according to their consequences for individuals. Here, we present a model of evolutionary dynamics of social norms that encompasses this objective and addresses the emergence of social norms. In this model, a norm is a set of behavioral prescriptions and a set of environmental descriptions that describe the expected behaviors of those with whom the norm holder will interact. These prescriptions and descriptions are functions of exogenous environmental events. These events have no intrinsic meaning or effect on the payoffs to individuals, yet beliefs/superstitions regarding them can effectuate coordination. Although a norm’s prescriptions and descriptions are dependent on one another, we show how they emerge from random accumulations of beliefs. We categorize the space of social norms into several natural classes and study the evolutionary competition between these classes of norms. We apply our model to the Game of Chicken and the Nash Bargaining Game. Furthermore, we show how the space of norms and evolutionary stability are dependent on the correlation structure of the environment and under which such correlation structures social dilemmas can be ameliorated or exacerbated.},

  abstract = {We study an extended version of a sender–receiver signaling game—a context-signaling (CS) game that involves external contextual cues that provide information about a sender’s private information state. A formal evolutionary analysis of the investigated CS game shows that ambiguous signaling strategies can achieve perfect information transfer and are evolutionarily stable. Moreover, a computational analysis of the CS game shows that such perfect ambiguous systems have the same emergence probability as non-ambiguous perfect signaling systems in multi-agent simulations under standard evolutionary dynamics. We contrast these results with an experimental study where pairs of participants play the CS game for multiple rounds with each other in the lab to develop a communication system. This comparison shows that unlike virtual agents, human agents clearly prefer perfect signaling systems over perfect ambiguous systems.},

  abstract = {To navigate their social worlds successfully, humans must coordinate their own behavior with the behaviors of others. Because human behavior takes place in a complex social world, it imposes high demand on cognitive capacity. Yet the cognitive resources available to humans to meet this demand are relatively limited. Selectivity is a crucial element in social cognition. Only through informational selection are humans able to make decisions that are simultaneously adaptive and ef�cient. This chapter reviews evidence from social cognition research which demonstrates that humans are selective in the social information they attend to, the manner in which they process this information, and the behaviors they ultimately enact. This selectivity in social attention, social thinking, and social behavior is an adaptive tool that helps humans successfully maneuver through their complex social worlds.},

"Humans are thus essentially interdependent: to survive and reproduce, they necessarily have to interact and coordinate with others. Social interaction and coordination, however, are dauntingly complex endeavors." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=1}{Mussweiler et al 2012:12})
\par
"Even a rudimentary understanding of social behavior necessarily entails a basic comprehension of how people think about others and how they process social information more generally." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=2}{Mussweiler et al 2012:13})
\par
"social information processing can be fruitfully differentiated into three conceptually distinct processing stages (though we readily admit that these processes might operate in parallel): Attention determines which novel social information enters our cognitive apparatus. This incoming information is then cognitively processed by relating it to stored social information. Finally, this processed information is transformed into a behavioral response." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=2}{Mussweiler et al 2012:13})

\par
"it is critical for people to be able to parse their surroundings quickly for the information that is most useful for confronting the challenges of day-to-day life, while simultaneously disregarding information that is not particularly relevant. That is, to navigate their social worlds effectively, perceivers must select from countless possibilities the information that will undergo additional processing."

"At the most basic level, stimuli that are novel, unique, or otherwise contextually distinct are among the most likely candidates selected to receive preferential attention." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=3}{Mussweiler et al 2012:14})
\par
"Also receiving attentional priority are stimuli which require an immediate behavioral response;" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=3}{Mussweiler et al 2012:14})
\par
"Along these same lines, the human perceptual system is adaptively tuned to notice selectively stimuli that have clear functional implications with respect to reproduction and survival." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=4}{Mussweiler et al 2012:15})

"it appears that highly personally relevant stimuli are especially likely to attract attention. A classic example of this is the  cocktail party phenomenon, whereby the sound of ones own name uttered from the opposite side of a crowded room seems to rise above the commotion and capture ones attention." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=4}{Mussweiler et al 2012:15})

\emph{This sounds similar to teleological thinking found in infants by [[@gergely2003|Gergely and Csibra (2003)]]. Also, [[@guala2020|Guala]] mentioned teleological thinking as connected to beliefless coordination. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=5}{note on p.16})}

"The functionality of noticing extremely negative stimuli notwithstanding, another reason why such stimuli capture attention is that they are normatively rare, unexpected, and thus attention grabbing." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=5}{Mussweiler et al 2012:16})
\par
"What are the central mechanisms that operate at this stage of information processing? 1. 2. 3. Comparative thinking allows people to relate knowledge about different stimuli or options to one another. Categorical thinking allows people to apply their stored social knowledge to novel social stimuli. Accessibility in� uences which cognitive content primarily in� uences social judgment and behavior. Notably, the selectivity that in� uences which information people attend to and which information thus enters their cognitive apparatus is also apparent in these mechanisms of social information processing. Selectivity shapes how incoming information is processed." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=6}{Mussweiler et al 2012:17})
\par
"When processing social information, when trying to make sense of others behaviors, or when trying to decide on a sensible course for ones own actions, people invariably engage in comparative thinking. Social judgment typically involves a comparison of the target person with one or more other people." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=6}{Mussweiler et al 2012:17})
\par
"categorical thinking typically encourages judges to focus on the most relevant of the multiple category memberships applicable to a given person and thus involves selectivity in information activation. The one category that is particularly salient, accessible, and relevant to the perceivers current goals becomes dominant and is thus called upon to guide social information processing, whereas alternative category memberships are inhibited (Bodenhausen and Macrae 1998)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=8}{Mussweiler et al 2012:19})
\par
"the way in which environmental input is transformed into behavioral output is characterized by the following three principles. 1. 2. 3. Re� ective behavior is guided by intentions that are shaped through accessible information about the desirability and feasibility of behavioral outcomes. Impulsive, nonintentional behavior selection is shaped by associative links. Impulsive and re� ective factors interact to produce behavior." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=9}{Mussweiler et al 2012:20})

"The attitude toward a particular behavior is determined by the sum of the expectancy that an action will lead to certain outcomes weighted by subjective values of those outcomes." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=9}{Mussweiler et al 2012:20})
\par
"Often, it is neither possible nor functional to engage in a relatively slow and effortful reasoning process. In many situations, it is suf�cient to act on the �rst association that comes to mind about a particular target. In other situations, quick, impulsive action may even be necessary for survival."

"Evidence suggests that in addition to a re�ective pathway, there is also an impulsive pathway that directly connects environmental input and behavioral output. This impulsive pathway relies on spreading activation in the memory network, which contains evaluative and semantic associations and preformed response patterns (habits), and elicits basic motivational orientations of approach versus avoidance. It can operate quickly and effortlessly, and its in- �uence on behavior may occur outside of conscious awareness (Strack and Deutsch 2004)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=10}{Mussweiler et al 2012:21})
\par
"In most situations, re� ective and impulsive precursors of behavior do not operate independently; instead, they interact in complex ways (Strack and Deutsch 2004). For example, propositions entertained by the re� ective system can increase the importance attached to certain associations by making them selectively accessible. Similarly, associations activated in the impulsive system can in� uence propositional reasoning in the re� ective system. Thus, impulsive and re� ective precursors may hold overlapping behavioral implications; however, these behavioral inclinations may also be incompatible." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=11}{Mussweiler et al 2012:22})
\par
"Because social behavior isby its very naturedirected toward and coordinated with complex others, it is necessarily complex itself. To cope with this complexity and to maneuver through their social worlds successfully, humans have to be selective in what social information they attend to, in how they process this information, and in which behaviors they engage. The foremost advantage of this selectivity in social cognition is that it reduces social complexity, thus allowing social thinkers to make ef�cient use of their limited cognitive processing capacity. At the same time, selectivity produces reasonably adaptive outputs." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XX6BR7WF?page=11}{Mussweiler et al 2012:22})

Next, I motivate Non-Inferentialism by showing that under the assumption of the widely-accepted Principle of Cognitive Economy, any account that treats mental state perception as an inferential process commits itself to an unrealistically inefficient picture of our cognitive architecture. Drawing on research in cognitive science, I will then show that my Non-Inferentialist view receives direct support by the available empirical evidence.

\par
the significance of free will is not exhausted by its connection to moral responsibility
\par
The main perceived threats to our freedom of will are various alleged determinisms: physical/causal; psychological; biological; theological. For each variety of determinism, there are philosophers who (i) deny its reality, either because of the existence of free will or on independent grounds; (ii) accept its reality but argue for its compatibility with free will; or (iii) accept its reality and deny its compatibility with free will. (See the entries on~\href{https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/compatibilism/}{compatibilism};~\href{https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/determinism-causal/}{causal determinism};~\href{https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/fatalism/}{fatalism};~\href{https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/}{arguments for incompatibilism}; and~\href{https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/}{divine foreknowledge and free will}.)
\par
More recently, Susan Wolf (1990) defends an asymmetry thesis concerning freedom and responsibility. On her view, an agent acts freely only if he had the ability to choose the True and the Good. For an agent who does so choose, the requisite ability is automatically implied. But those who reject the Good choose freely only if they could have acted differently. This is a further substantive condition on freedom, making freedom of will a more demanding condition in cases of bad choices.
\par
Harry Frankfurt (1982) presents an insightful and original way of thinking about free will. He suggests that a central difference between human and merely animal activity is our capacity to reflect on our desires and beliefs and form desires and judgments concerning them. I may want to eat a candy bar (first-order desire), but I also may want~\emph{not to want}~this (second-order desire) because of the connection between habitual candy eating and poor health. This difference, he argues, provides the key to understanding both free action and free will. (These are quite different, in Frankfurt's view, with free will being the more demanding notion. Moreover, moral responsibility for an action requires only that the agent acted freely, not that the action proceeded from a free will.)
\par
My~\emph{will}~is free when I am~\emph{able}~to make any of my first-order desires the one upon which I act. As it happens, I will to eat the candy bar, but I could have willed to refrain from doing so.
\par
Clearly, our capacity for deliberation and the potential sophistication of some of our practical reflections are important conditions on freedom of will. But any proposed analysis of free will must also ensure that the process it describes is one that was up to, or controlled by, the agent.
\par
John Martin Fischer (1994) distinguishes two sorts of control over one's actions: guidance and regulative. A person exerts guidance control over his own actions insofar as they proceed from a ‘weakly’ reasons-responsive (deliberative) mechanism. This obtains just in case there is some~\emph{possible}~scenario where the agent is presented with a sufficient reason to do otherwise and the mechanism that led to the actual choice is operative and it issues in a different choice, one appropriate to the imagined reason.
\par
Conditional analyses of ability to do otherwise have been popular among compatibilists. The general idea here is that to say that I am able to do otherwise is to say that I~\emph{would}~do otherwise if it were the case that … , where the ellipsis is filled by some elaboration of “I had an appropriately strong desire to do so, or I had different beliefs about the best available means to satisfy my goal, or … .” In short: something about my prevailing character or present psychological states would have differed, and so would have brought about a different outcome in my deliberation.
\par
We may distinguish two broad families of ‘incompatibilist’ or ‘indeterminist’ self-determination accounts. The more radical group holds that the agent who determines his own will is not causally influenced by external causal factors, including his own character.
\par
A more moderate grouping within the self-determination approach to free will allows that beliefs, desires, and external factors all can causally influence the act of free choice itself. But theorists within this camp differ sharply on the metaphysical nature of those choices and of the causal role of reasons. We may distinguish three varieties.~
\par
1. First is a noncausal (or ownership) account (Ginet 1990, 2002; McCann 1998; Pink 2004; Goetz 2002). According to this view, I control my volition or choice simply in virtue of its being mine—its occurring in me. I do not exert a special kind of causality in bringing it about; instead, it is an intrinsically active event, intrinsically something I~\emph{do}. Reasons provide an autonomous, non-causal form of explanation

\par
2. Proponents of the event-causal account (e.g. Nozick 1995; Ekstrom 2001; and Franklin forthcoming) would say that uncaused events of any kind would be random and uncontrolled by anyone, and so could hardly count as choices that an agent~\emph{made}. They hold that reasons influence choices precisely by causing them. Choices are~\emph{free}~insofar as they are not deterministically caused, and so might not have occurred in just the circumstances in which they did occur.
\par
3. Finally, there are those who believe freedom of will consists in a distinctively personal form of causality, commonly referred to as “agent causation.” The agent himself causes his choice or action, and this is not to be reductively analyzed as an event within the agent causing the choice.
\par
Libet himself concludes that the studies provide strong evidence that actions are already underway shortly~\emph{before}~the agent wills to do it. As a result, we do not consciously initiate our actions, though he suggests that we might nonetheless retain the ability to~\emph{veto}~actions that are initiated by unconscious psychological structures. Wegner (2002) amasses a range of studies (including those of Libet) to argue that the notion that human actions are ever initiated by their own conscious willings is simply a deeply-entrenched illusion and proceeds to offer an hypothesis concerning the reason this illusion is generated within our cognitive systems. Mele (2009) and O'Connor (2009b) argue that the data adduced by Libet, Wegner, and others wholly fail to support their revisionary conclusions.

«As I’ve hinted at, breaking groups into social categories isn’t the only way to solve complementary coordination problems. In particular, there are a few solution concepts that bear some relationship to type-based solutions. The first is from Aumann (1974, 1987), who describes what he calls correlated equilibria. These are equilibria where actors use some external correlating device to determine which equilibrium to choose when confronted with games with multiple equilibria.» (O'Connor, 2019, p. 68)

«Skyrms (2014) discusses the evolution of correlating devices to solve the coordination problem in hawk–dove. He points out that strategies incorporating an external correlating device take over populations without such strategies. Where do such correlational devices come from, though? (We can’t use traffic lights for everything.) In complementary coordination games, another way to think about the role types and typeconditioning can play in coordination is as a correlating device. The observable difference between players takes the role of the trafficlightin providing the extra information necessary for equilibrium selection.» (O'Connor, 2019, p. 69)
\par
«The second concept, arguably more relevant to that of types and typeconditioning in coordination games, is that of uncorrelated asymmetry, from Maynard-Smith (1982) who addresses complementary coordination games in the biological realm. In these games, as he points out, actors can use extra bits of information unrelated to the game in question, or uncorrelated asymmetries, to break symmetry. These allow actors to figure out who plays which role and so turn complementary coordination games to correlative coordination games. To s e e how t his works, consider anot her example employing haw kdove, but now where the players involve a property owner and an intruder on the property. In this problem, there is extra information, which is that one player is the owner and the other the intruder. A single convention such as “play hawk if owner and dove if intruder” can solve the population coordination problem (Maynard-Smith and Parker, 1976;Skyrms,2014). With types and type-conditioning, something very similar is happening. Actors are using observable types to turn the game into a correlative coordination game. Now the uncorrelated asymmetries are social categories, and the choices that the entire population arrives at are things like “play A if woman and B if man.” There is a disanalogy, of course, because men and women have no chance to play the other role. This also means that they need not keep track of a conditional behavioral rule, (i.e., they don’t need to know what to do when in the other situation).» (O'Connor, 2019, p. 69)
\par
«Note both of these concepts can be phrased in terms of information. A correlating device gives extra information to the players which they Moonlight can play the role of an external correlating device that allows actors to correlate their behavior (Kaniewska et al., 2015). In this case, the solution is both conventionalbecause there are multiple possible solutions—and functional, because moonlight itself correlates with the state of the tides, so there are better and worse levels of moonlight to use for coordination» (O'Connor, 2019, p. 69)
\par
«OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 21/5/2019,SPi other concepts for complementary coordination 57 use to choose roles in a coordination game. An uncorrelated asymmetry builds extra information into the structure of the game. This, of course, ties into the idea of conceiving of types as signals to other players. Under this framework, types are literally a way of transferring information to the other opponent to allow for coordination.» (O'Connor, 2019, p. 70)
\par
«Maynard-Smith and Price (1973) introduced this concept of evolutionarily stable strategies to identify strategies that are stable against invasion of mutants. ESSes in games can be identified through payoff tables alone. In this way, although a dynamic concept, ESSes do not depend on the choice of dynamic, and are stable for any dynamics that increase the proportion of strategies with higher payoffs. A strategy xi is an ESS if u(xi, xj)isthepayoff of strategy xi played against xj and : 1) u(xi, xi) {$>$} u(xi, xj)or2) u(xi, xi) = u(xi, xj)and u(xi, xj) {$>$} u(xj, xj)forallxj̸=xi.» (O'Connor, 2019, p. 123)},

  abstract = {Standard accounts of convention include notions of arbitrariness. But many have conceived of conventionality as an all-or-nothing affair. In this paper, I develop a framework for thinking of conventions as admitting of degrees of arbitrariness. In doing so, I introduce an information-theoretic measure intended to capture the degree to which a solution to a certain social problem could have been otherwise. As the paper argues, this framework can help to improve explanation aimed at the cultural evolution of social traits. Good evolutionary explanations recognise that most functional traits are also conventional, at least to some degree, and vice versa.},

«In explaining the presence or persistence of a cultural trait, we often appeal to functionality—that is, a trait emerges and persists by improving the well-being or fitness of those employing it. Conventions, on the other hand, are often explained as arbitrary, or as the result of chance occurrences. The framework here contributes to recent work that attempts to break down this division. Most cultural traits are functional, to some degree, and yet still could have been otherwise, to some degree, and can only be successfully explained as such.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 2)
\par
«For Lewis, conventions are usefully thought of as a special sort of equilibrium in games with multiple equilibria. The coordination game just introduced has two Nash equilibria, or sets of strategies where neither player can unilaterally switch and improve their payoff—A vs A and B vs B. Lewis introduces a refinement which he calls a proper coordination equilibrium—where no player can unilaterally change strategies and improve payoff for any other player. He uses these to identify possible conventions in games, including the two Nash equilibria just described. For Lewis, game theory gives a precise notion of why conventions might emerge as stable behavioural patterns: at equilibrium, each player has a payoff incentive to keep playing the same strategy. In addition, it gives a clear notion of arbitrariness: there are two proper coordination equilibria in this game that the players might have selected. Notice that, for Lewis, ‘arbitrariness’ of a convention is synonymous with a live possibility that the pattern of behaviour in question could have been otherwise. And, as noted, this is the sense of arbitrariness relevant to the project here.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 3)
\par
«Members of a group must conform to an equilibrium, must expect other group members to conform, must prefer to conform when others do, and must prefer each member to conform when the group does. In addition, Lewis stipulates that group members must have very similar preferences over the equilibri» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 3)
\par
«They define three dimensions along which a convention could be more or less natural vs arbitrary. (1) Some conventions are better from a payoff standpoint. (2) Some conventions are more likely to emerge. And (3) some conventions are more stable than others. Once these have emerged, they are not likely to be abandoned.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 5) @simons2019 subdivide a "functiona—arbitrary" axis into three dimensions:
\par
«Evolutionary models allow us to specify what Simons and Zollman [2019] mean by conventions being (2) more or less likely to emerge, and (3) more or less stable. Suppose that a group learns to play the game in figure 2. And suppose that they change strategies by imitating group members who do well. We can use the replicator dynamics to represent this state of affairs. Over time, these dynamics select for strategies that do better than average. For this reason, they track both natural selection and cultural imitation well [Weibull 1997]. Under these dynamics, when x=1, the population evolves to play A whenever more than 50\% of its members play A, otherwise B.3» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 5)
\par
«For a coordination game where x {$>$} 1, the B equilibrium is more ‘natural’ in sense (1), of yielding higher payoffs. And, as a result, it will also have a larger basin of attraction. If x=50, the phase diagram for this model will look like the one in figure 4. The basin of attraction for A makes up only 2\% of the space, with 98\% for B. If we do not know much about the starting place of the population, we can take these basins to represent the probability that each outcome evolves. So, on the second scale, again, B is a more natural convention.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 6)
\par
«I move away from the three-division scale proposed by Simons and Zollman [2019], and I focus Figure 3. A phase diagram for a simple coordination game. Figure 4. A phase diagram for a simple coordination game where one option yields significantly higher payoffs. 6 CAILIN O’CONNO» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 6)
\par
«mostly on their second sense of naturalness—probability of emergence. Arguably, this best tracks whether a convention really could have been otherwise (although shortly we will see that sense (3) can also be addressed by using the measure). Could some other outcome have emerged on a cultural evolutionary timescale, and how likely is it to have done so? In answering this, I draw on information theory, first introduced by Shannon [1948], which is typically used to address questions related to the transfer of information.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 7)
\par
«What is the connection between information theory and convention? As we have seen, different equilibria can have different probabilities of emerging. Equilibria with large basins of attraction are more likely to evolve than small ones are.4 The sizes of the basins thus tell us something about how much information we gain, for some domain, upon seeing what evolved. This level of information will be our measure of arbitrariness. It is higher when there is a lot of uncertainty about what will evolve, and lower for less uncertainty. To be clear, the reason why I use information theory here rather than some other framework is simply that it is the theory that deals with questions like this one: how much do we learn upon observing the outcome of a variable process?» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 7)
\par
«The relevant information-theoretic measure is Shannon entropy, which tells us, for some channel, how much information on average is transmitted.5 An amount of information corresponds, intuitively, to how much we learn upon observing something, or how surprised we are to see it. The entropy measure is this: H(x) = ∑i P(xi)I(xi). H(x) is entropy. It is calculated by taking the sum, over all of the possible signals, i, that can come through a channel, of the probabilities of those signals (P(xi)) multiplied by the information contained in each (I(xi)). The information per signal I(xi) is equal to -log2P(xi). Why? The negative log of P(x) is 0 when P(x) =1, and so a completely certain signal carries no information. This makes sense, as we learn nothing upon observing it. As P(x) decreases, -log2P(x) increases arbitrarily, meaning that, the more unlikely a signal is, the more information it carries. That is, we learn more upon observing it. Using -log2 will give us the number of bits in a signal. Another log gives a different unit of information. Altogether, the measure weights the probability that each signal is sent, by the amount of information in that signal, to give the average information in the channel.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 7) The idea that the more unlikely or surprising a signal is, the more information it carries is aligned with [[Free Energy Principle]]. @friston2010 addresses the connection between FEP and information theory, and @beni2021 explain it formally with log.

This calculator illustrates how negative log increases with a signal~ probability decreasing — https://www.omnicalculator.com/math/negative-log
\par
«Other things being equal, a channel has higher entropy when the signals being sent are closer to equiprobable. If so, we learn more on average than if, say, one signal is sent 99\% of the time, and the other 1\% of the time. The entropy of this biased channel is just .08. A channel will also have higher entropy, holding other things equal, when there are more signals. The more messages that we might receive, the more that we learn upon observing any single one.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 7)
\par
«We take the sizes of the basins of attraction to be our probabilities P(xi). Thus, arbitrariness is higher whenever we learn more, on average, upon observing the outcome of an evolutionary process. If there are more equilibria, or their basins of attraction are closer to being equally sized, then, holding other aspects fixed, the problem will be more arbitrary, or, we might say, ‘more conventional’.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 8)
\par
«We can also specify, though, the information value of any particular outcome, -log2P(x). We can use this to specify the naturalness of a particular convention àla Simons and Zollman [2019]. The closer that -log2P(x) is to 0, the more natural the convention.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 8)
\par
«While I have described this measure by using basins of attraction, it can actually be applied whenever we have some clear way to define probabilities for different evolutionary outcomes.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 8)
\par
«First, we sometimes have information about the starting point of an evolving population. Maybe a nation is developing a driving convention but has many immigrants from a right-hand-side driving country—hence, a high probability of starting with a lot of A players. In such cases, basins of attraction will not adequately track the probability that each equilibrium emerges. What we can do is specify a probability distribution over possible population starting places. This gives us new probabilities for whether a population will start in each basin of attraction, and thus allows us to measure the arbitrariness of the process.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 8)
\par
«Alternatively, unlike the replicator dynamics, some dynamics are stochastic: each starting point can end up at multiple equilibria, depending on chance events. Once again, though, we can redefine the inputs to the entropy equation to get a conventionality measure. Suppose that we model ten individuals playing the game in figure 2 with x=10. And suppose that we simulate it 10k times, and we find that the A equilibrium emerges for 6\% of these and B for 94\%. We can take these as the probabilities for the two equilibria.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 8)
\par
«Actual chances are not observable. We cannot know the real underlying probabilities for different evolutionary outcomes. Indeed, many argue there are no such probabilities, only our uncertainty about states of affairs. There are deep philosophical issues here, and it is beyond this paper to address them. The point is simply that the probabilities feeding into our measure must be representations of some sort. Given this, there will always be different plausible ways to choose probabilities for any scenario. For example, in many real-world scenarios it will not be plausible to exactly define each possible strategy and the exact payoffs associated with each.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 9)
\par
«A further issue arises because, in addition to flexibility in representation, there are often different things that one might be trying to represent when it comes to cultural evolutionary processes. These processes are extended in time and space, constrained by other cultural factors, and shaped by surrounding cultural influences.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 9) On problem with a conventionality measure proposed by @oconnor2021 is its representatioin-dependence. It means that inputs in an entropy equation can be selected quite arbitrarily depending on a case.
\par
«There is not a final ultimate solution to these worries. The best response is that representations should be sensitive to the explanatory projects at which they are aimed. If a researcher asks, ‘How conventional is the emergence of gendered division of labour, setting aside other constraints?’, her best representation might be an idealised model that considers how sex differences shape cultural evolution. If she asks, ‘How conventional is food preparation in cultures with plough-based agriculture?’, she might want a data set of real patterns of conventional behaviour in plough-based cultures. As we will see, in some cases researchers might have reason to compare arbitrariness across several different representations of the same case. Of course, even a well-tailored representation will not be perfect. There will still be degrees of freedom in how it is created. The inherent limitations in representations, and thus the measure here, should be recognised, but should not be taken to prevent good (enough) inquiry.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 10)
\par
«With this picture in hand, let us briefly return to one more worry about probabilities, before continuing to cases. If there are no real physical chances, there is no real sense in which any convention could actually have evolved to be otherwise. And, if so, there are no conventions in the sense developed here. Recognising that the measure is representation-dependent solves this problem, though. We can specify what we mean by probability in the context of a particular model or data set (basins of attraction, probability of emergence over many rounds of simulation, time spent at equilibrium, percentage of real societies that adopt a behaviour) and set aside worries about probability and chance in the world.» (O’Connor, 2021, p. 10) Representation-dependence of the conventionality measure solves the problem of the source of probabilities—are they physical chances or not.},

I study a general n × n matrix game and derive a basic equation that describes the change in frequency of strategies. A close observation of this equation reveals that three distinct effects are at work: direct benefit to a focal individual, kin-selected indirect benefit to the focal individual via its relatives, and the cost caused by increased kin competition in the focal individual's natal deme. Crucial parameters are the coefficient of relatedness between two individuals and its analogue for three individuals. I provide a number of examples and show when the traditional inclusive fitness measure is recovered and when not. Results demonstrate how evolutionary game theory fits into the framework of kin selection.}

In rational choice theory, agents are assumed to make choices that maximize their utility; in evolution, natural selection 'chooses' between phenotypes according to the criterion of fitness maximization. So there is a parallel between utility in rational choice theory and fitness in Darwinian theory. This conceptual link between fitness and utility is mirrored by the interesting parallels between formal models of evolution and rational choice. The essays in this volume, by leading philosophers, economists, biologists and psychologists, explore the connection between evolution and rational choice in a number of different contexts, including choice under uncertainty, strategic decision making and pro-social behaviour.

  abstract = {In this essay, I begin with the premise that everyday organizing is inextricably bound up with materiality and contend that this relationship is inadequately reflected in organizational studies that tend to ignore it, take it for granted, or treat it as a special case. The result is an understanding of organizing and its conditions and consequences that is necessarily limited. I then argue for an alternative approach, one that posits the constitutive entanglement of the social and the material in everyday life. I draw on some empirical examples to help ground and illustrate this approach in practice and conclude by suggesting that a reconfiguration of our conventional assumptions and considerations of materiality will help us more effectively recognize and understand the multiple, emergent, and shifting sociomaterial assemblages entailed in contemporary organizing.},

  abstract = {Spontaneous social coordination has been extensively described in natural settings but so far no controlled methodological approaches have been employed that systematically advance investigations into the possible self-organized nature of bond formation and dissolution between humans. We hypothesized that, under certain contexts, spontaneous synchrony-a well-described phenomenon in biological and physical settings-could emerge spontaneously between humans as a result of information exchange. Here, a new way to quantify interpersonal interactions in real time is proposed. In a simple experimental paradigm, pairs of participants facing each other were required to actively produce actions, while provided (or not) with the vision of similar actions being performed by someone else. New indices of interpersonal coordination, inspired by the theoretical framework of coordination dynamics (based on relative phase and frequency overlap between movements of individuals forming a pair) were developed and used. Results revealed that spontaneous phase synchrony (i.e., unintentional in-phase coordinated behavior) between two people emerges as soon as they exchange visual information, even if they are not explicitly instructed to coordinate with each other. Using the same tools, we also quantified the degree to which the behavior of each individual remained influenced by the social encounter even after information exchange had been removed, apparently a kind of social memory.},

Notions like "denumerability," "modal scope distinction," "Bayesian conditionalization," and "logical completeness" are usually only elucidated deep within difficult specialist texts. By offering simple explanations that by-pass much irrelevant and boring detail, Philosophical Devices is able to cover a wealth of material that is normally only available to specialists. The book contains four sections, each of three chapters. The first section is about sets and numbers, starting with the membership relation and ending with the generalized continuum hypothesis. The second is about analyticity, a prioricity, and necessity. The third is about probability, outlining the difference between objective and subjective probability and exploring aspects of conditionalization and correlation. The fourth deals with metalogic, focusing on the contrast between syntax and semantics, and finishing with a sketch of Godel's theorem. Philosophical Devices will be useful for university students who have got past the foothills of philosophy and are starting to read more widely, but it does not assume any prior expertise. All the issues discussed are intrinsically interesting, and often downright fascinating. It can be read with pleasure and profit by anybody who is curious about the technical infrastructure of contemporary philosophy."--p. 4 of cover},

For much of its history, research on social networks has assumed that social networks behave like other similarly large, interconnected structures. However, the nodes that make up social networks—human beings—think and behave in flexible, complex, and often seemingly irrational ways. A deep understanding of social networks, therefore, requires not only analysis at the network level but also an understanding of how such networks shape and are shaped by the psychological processes of their members. In recent years, psychology has begun to make inroads into the network literature, but while neuroscience is an increasingly important area of psychology, research on the neuroscience of social networks remains scarce. This chapter reviews extant research pertaining to the neuroscience of social networks and sketches a research agenda to augment this already interdisciplinary field with insights from neuroscience.},

This chapter describes and assesses several constraints that could help converge towards a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for joint action. The tightness constraint favours definitions that fit joint actions in which the links between agents are as relaxed as possible, so as to better pinpoint the conceptual core of jointness. The developmental constraint asks for definitions based on realistic psychological states that could be entertained by agents less cognitively developed than ideal human beings. The motor constraint holds that definitions should refer to psychological mechanisms involved in actual human coordination. These first three constraints are discussed and dismissed, mainly because they manage to establish vague limits at best (for various reasons). I then introduce a fourth one, the efficiency constraint, based on the fact that most of our joint actions are generally successful, and according to which definitions should involve conditions that help justify this success. Finally, the rational and evolutionary versions of the efficiency constraint are examined and defended against objections.},

Many find this claim incredible: it seems that a whole and its parts must be distinct, for the whole is one thing while its parts are many things. Byeong-uk Yi has developed a version of this argument which exploits the resources of plural logic. Yi provides logical analyses of the predicates 'one' and 'many' which seem to show that nothing can satisfy them both. But there are (at least) two senses of the word 'one'. One of these senses is not captured by Yi's analysis, and in this sense of the word, it is logically possible for many things to be one. Moreover, we should only believe that a whole is one thing in this sense, not that it is one thing in the sense Yi has analysed. Thus, we can identify wholes with their parts without contradiction.}

We trace a portion of the history of this concept, beginning with the theologically and economically grounded work of Linnaeus, moving through Darwin’s adaptation of the economy of nature and its reconstitution in genetic terms during the first decades of the Modern Synthesis. What this historical case study reveals, we argue, is a window into the shifting landscape of the explanatory and ontic uses of structural concepts. In Linnaeus, the economy of nature has both ontic and explanatory import; in Darwin the ontic and explanatory aspects start to come apart (with the explanatory aspect being foregrounded); and finally, in the Modern Synthesis, the economy of nature is replaced by the conceptual toolkit of population genetics, the structural elements of which are nearly entirely explanatory. Having traced a historical trajectory of structural concepts that moves from an ontic formulation to an increasingly explanatory one, we conclude by outlining some insights for structural realism.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

«Skyrms's emphasis in developing an evolutionary interpretation of Lewis's model has been on robustness, showing that Lewisian signaling can arise in many variants of an evolutionary model.» (Planer и Godfrey‐Smith, 2021, p. 3)
\par
«Skyrms then noted that simple models of change by natural selection are not only models of biological evolution. Any process in which successful behavioral dispositions are retained and unsuccessful ones dropped, by “trial and error” in a broad sense, has some fit to the dynamics of evolution. This might be reinforcement learning (trial and error by individuals). It might be differential imitation, rather than differential reproduction. If successful behaviors at one timestep are imitated at the next step more than unsuccessful behaviors—imitation of the successful—this also allows adaptive behaviors to proliferate in the population.» (Planer и Godfrey‐Smith, 2021, p. 3)
\par
«Hence, there is a family of selection processes that can stabilize Lewisian signaling. The four we have mentioned can be roughly ordered by their increasing cognitive demands: Biological evolution, reinforcement learning, imitation of the successful, and rational choice. These selection processes work on different time-scales and produce somewhat different outcomes, but all can stabilize Lewisian signaling in some cases.» (Planer и Godfrey‐Smith, 2021, p. 4)
\par
«The Lewis model is a model of the use of signs to enable coordination of receiver acts with states of the world. This can be called act–state coordination. There is another kind of coordination that communication can help to achieve, coordination between two agents' acts: Act–act coordination. It might be that the sender first decides how to act and then sends a sign, with the receiver conditioning their own act on what they see. Alternatively, it might be that both sides send and receive.» (Planer и Godfrey‐Smith, 2021, p. 4)
\par
«The sender–receiver structure, then, has a dual role. It describes a natural configuration, one that occurs on many scales. And it describes a target of our interpretive habits. A full treatment of communication and meaning will include both of these: it will describe the actual role played by signs in mediating between sender and receiver, and also how we respond to sign systems when we encounter them as onlookers and theorists. Given these habits, we will often be tempted to describe marginal cases in ways that really apply only to paradigm cases. We have habits of response that are shaped by experience with paradigm public cases and these habits carry over when we encounter partial cases in areas like biology.» (Planer и Godfrey‐Smith, 2021, p. 8)
\par
«There is a question regarding how “cooperation” is to be taken in this context. Some theorists—in particular, Gloria Origgi and Dan Sperber (2000)—hold that only “cooperation” in a very minimal sense is required: The sender must be motivated to be understood, and the receiver to understand, where understanding does not imply accepting-as-true what is said. Others make stronger claims, where there can be no doubt that sender and receiver interaction is held to require a broader form of cooperation. It is this stronger view that is most relevant here. We see these theorists as guided by the following thought: If a sender provides information about the world to another agent whose interests are diametrically opposed, then any receiver's actions guided by that information are likely to be unwelcome, and the sender is better off providing no information at all.» (Planer и Godfrey‐Smith, 2021, p. 9)
\par
«in the absence of common interest or differential costs, signs will evolve towards meaninglessness.» (Planer и Godfrey‐Smith, 2021, p. 10)
\par
«Between-agent sign use functions primarily in transmission. This is not so in the within-theorganism case. Internal signs are routinely combined and processed so as to yield new information that is useful for the control of behavior. In general, they are for carrying out computations of various sorts at least as much as they are for transmitting information. We think this facilitates the evolution of highly organized sign systems, and see a co-evolutionary feedback loop here. As an organism's internal signs become more organized, computation becomes more efficient, and as computation becomes more efficient, it “pays” to represent more information, more states of the world, because one can get more out of them.» (Planer и Godfrey‐Smith, 2021, p. 12)
\par
«The models treat sender–receiver coadaptation, construed broadly, as the core property of communication; the way signs are produced is sensitive to and shaped by the way signs are interpreted, and vice-versa. Against this background, we now look at a long-standing divide among theories of meaning (“meta-semantic” theories). We see these theories as tending to fall into two traditions or styles of explanation, namely, expressive and interpretative traditions. Expressive tradition: The basis of meaning is what senders are trying to get across to a receiver, or trying to get them to do. Interpretative tradition: The basis of meaning is what receivers make of a sign, of how they interpret it, or what they get from it. A vivid example of this divide in the philosophy of language can be seen in the work of Paul Grice and Donald Davidson. Grice gave a theory of how speakers use language to express ideas and to achieve things, where an important theoretical category is what is said using some bit of language. This idea was developed differently by neo-Griceans and “relevance theorists,” though in both cases, the focus remained on the speaker. The opposite tendency is illustrated by Davidson; he gave a view of language based on the properties of good interpretation, of how an interpreter might make sense of a stream of speech.13» (Planer и Godfrey‐Smith, 2021, p. 13)
\par
«Experimental research over the last two decades suggests that human “theory of mind” is a cognitive mosaic, a mix of different tracking and inferential abilities with separate evolutionary histories (and in some cases, cultural evolutionary histories). It is now widely accepted, for example, that chimpanzees can attribute goal states and states of visual perception to others.20 In children, a suite of “low-level” or “implicit” mindreading abilities come on-line early, allowing them to make certain behavioral predictions in a limited range of circumstances. This is followed by the development of “explicit” abilities to recognize goals, perceptual states, thoughts, and emotions in the second and third year.

  abstract = {Teleosemantics explains mental representation in terms of etiological history: a mental state's representational contents are the result of natural selection, or some other selection process. Critics have argued that the "swampman" thought experiment poses a counterexample to teleosemantics. In several recent papers, Papineau has argued that a merely possible swampman cannot serve as a counterexample to teleosemantics, but has acknowledged that actual swampmen would pose a problem for teleosemantics. In this paper, I argue that there are real-world cases of swampman-like representation, in the form of functional tetrachromacy. People with functional tetrachromacy are born with four types of cones in each eye, rather than the usual three, and as a result can represent a wider variety of colors than the average person. I argue that the functional tetrachromat's additional color representations are not the result of a selection process. Functional tetrachromacy is therefore a real-world case of mental representation without an etiological history, and therefore poses a genuine counterexample to teleosemantics.}

Explaining the Neolithic transition from small- to large-scale societies involves understanding how these institutions co-evolve with demography. We study this using a demographically explicit model of institution formation in a patch-structured population. Each patch supports both social and asocial niches. Social individuals create an institution, at a cost to themselves, by negotiating how much of the costly public good provided by cooperators is invested into sanctioning defectors. The remainder of their public good is invested in technology that increases carrying capacity, such as irrigation systems. We show that social individuals can invade a population of asocials, and form institutions that support high levels of cooperation. We then demonstrate conditions where the co-evolution of cooperation, institutions, and demographic carrying capacity creates a transition from small- to large-scale social groups.},

By reviewing the exchange and collective-action dilemmas in both small-scale and large-scale societies, we show they are not different. Second, are individual decision-making mechanisms driven by self-interest? We extract from the literature three types of individual decision-making mechanism, which differ in their social influence and sensitivity to self-interest, to conclude that humans interacting with non-relatives are largely driven by self-interest. We then ask: what was the key mechanism that allowed prosocial behaviors to continue as societies grew? We show the key role played by new social interaction mechanisms—change in the rules of exchange and collective-action dilemmas—devised by the interacting individuals, which allow for self-interested individuals to remain prosocial as societies grow.},

Instead, we suggest that the different varieties of context-dependence are best seen as corresponding to different research goals.

Three prominent claims from Craver (Explaining the brain: mechanisms and the mosaic unity of neuroscience, Oxford University Press, Oxford, {$<$}a href="\#CR6"{$>$}2007{$<$}/a{$>$}) form a promising basis for an account. First, constitutive relevance is established by means of interlevel experiments. Second, interlevel experiments are executions of interventions. Third, there is no interlevel causation between a mechanism and its components. Currently, no account on offer respects all three claims. I offer my causal situationist account of constitutive relevance that respects the claims. By situating a part of a mechanism on the causal chain between the mechanism's input and output, components can be identified with interventions, without the interventions suggesting interlevel causation. The causal situationist account is the only account on offer so far that clearly fits within Craver's ({$<$}a href="\#CR6"{$>$}2007{$<$}/a{$>$}) framework.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We attempt to integrate several related approaches in the study of the embodied, cognitive, and affective substrates of sociality and culture and the sociocultural scaffolding of experience. The integrative framework we propose bridges cognitive and social sciences to provide (i) an expanded concept of ‘affordance’ that extends to sociocultural forms of life, and (ii) a multilevel account of the socioculturally scaffolded forms of affordance learning and the transmission of affordances in patterned sociocultural practices and regimes of shared attention. This framework provides an account of how cultural content and normative practices are built on a foundation of contentless basic mental processes that acquire content through immersive participation of the agent in social practices that regulate joint attention and shared intentionality.},

The aim of this review is to synthesise these advances with a meta-theoretical ontology of biological systems called variational neuroethology, which integrates the FEP with Tinbergen's four research questions to explain biological systems across spatial and temporal scales. We exemplify this framework by applying it to Homo sapiens, before translating variational neuroethology into a systematic research heuristic that supplies the biological, cognitive, and social sciences with a computationally tractable guide to discovery.},

However, a computational model specifying how people select strategies from their repertoire is still lacking. The proposed strategy selection learning (SSL) theory predicts a strategy selection process on the basis of reinforcement learning. The theory assumes that individuals develop subjective expectations for the strategies they have and select strategies proportional to their expectations, which are then updated on the basis of subsequent experience. The learning assumption was supported in 4 experimental studies. Participants substantially improved their inferences through feedback. In all 4 studies, the best-performing strategy from the participants’ repertoires most accurately predicted the inferences after sufficient learning opportunities. When testing SSL against 3 models representing extensions of SSL and against an exemplar model assuming a memory-based inference process, the authors found that SSL predicted the inferences most accurately.},

Here I develop and motivate a structuralist ontology of social groups centered on social structures (i.e., networks of relations that are constitutively dependent on social factors). The view delivers a picture that encompasses a diverse range of social groups, while maintaining important metaphysical and normative distinctions between groups of different kinds. It also meets the constraint that not every arbitrary collection of people is a social group. In addition, the framework provides resources for developing a broader structuralist view in social ontology.},

  abstract = {Trust can transform conflicting interests into cooperation. But how can individuals know when to trust others? Here, I develop the theory that reputation building may signal cooperative intent, or trustworthiness. I model a simple representation of this theory in which individuals (1) optionally invest in a reputation by performing costly helpful behaviour (signalling); (2) optionally use others reputations when choosing a partner; and (3) optionally cooperate with that partner. In evolutionary simulations, high levels of reputation building; of choosing partners based on reputation; and of cooperation within partnerships emerged. Costly helping behaviour evolved into an honest signal of trustworthiness when it was adaptive for cooperators, relative to defectors, to invest in the long-term benefits of a reputation for helping. I show using game theory that this occurs when cooperators gain larger marginal benefits from investing in signalling than do defectors. This happens without the usual costly signalling assumption that individuals are of two types which differ in quality. Signalling of trustworthiness may help explain phenomena such as philanthropy, pro-sociality, collective action, punishment, and advertising in humans and may be particularly applicable to courtship in other animals.}

"There are two other less practical and more philosophical arguments for the importance science attaches to laws. First, the kind of explanation science seeks is causal, and causal knowledge requires regularities. Second, the certification of scientific claims as knowledge comes from observation, experiments, and the collection of data. Only generalizations that bear on the future can be tested by new data." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WLY8PPRH?page=3}{Rosenberg 2018:13})
\par
"Because strict, exceptionless laws are hard to find in everyday life, we make do with roughandready empirical regularities to underwrite particular causal claims. In the sciences— natural and social—these rough regularities oen take the form of statistical generalizations. Much statistical methodology is devoted to distinguishing merely coincidental statistical correlations from correlations that reflect real causal sequences." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WLY8PPRH?page=3}{Rosenberg 2018:13})
\par
"Since, even in individual cases, our knowledge of causation is based on the preliminary identification of generalizations, which themselves are refined through the repeated observation of similar sequences, it is no surprise that such observation is what tests our explanatory and predictive hypotheses and certifies them as justified knowledge. Hume's analysis of the nature of causation as constant conjunction means that our knowledge of individual causal sequences is justified only if we can successfully predict further effects when we observe their causes. If Hume is right about causation, prediction is the sine qua non of causal knowledge." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WLY8PPRH?page=4}{Rosenberg 2018:14})
\par
"Positivists wanted to limit meaningful discourse to what could be tested by the methods of science and to the logical analysis of the discourse that can be provided by the methods science uses." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WLY8PPRH?page=4}{Rosenberg 2018:14})
\par
"Positivists also devoted much time to developing accounts of the nature of scientific theories and the structure of scientific explanation. Since scientific explanation uncovers causal mechanisms, it must involve laws. The theory of explanation they advanced is called the "deductivenomological" or "coveringlaw" theory: to explain a particular event, one deduces its occurrence from a set of one or more laws of nature together with a description of the "initial" conditions that the laws require for the occurrence of the event to be explained. Thus, we can explain why a car's radiator burst by deducing from the facts that the temperature fell below freezing, and the radiator was full of water, and the law that water expands when it freezes into ice. Similarly, the positivists pointed out, given the law about the expansion of water at its freezing temperature, we can predict that the full radiator will break if we know that the temperature is falling below freezing. Thus, according to positivists, explanation and prediction are two sides of the same coin. The role of successful prediction in certifying that explanations are correct was only the beginning of its importance for the positivists' conception of knowledge." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WLY8PPRH?page=5}{Rosenberg 2018:15})
\par
"The progressive accumulation of knowledge in science is thus certified by its increasing predictive success." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WLY8PPRH?page=6}{Rosenberg 2018:16})
\par
"The history of science is the history of narrower theories being "reduced" to broader theories. One theory is reduced to another when the distinctive fundamental assumptions of the first theory—its axioms—can be derived as theorems from the fundamental assumptions of the broader theory. This will ensure that the predictive successes of a theory are preserved by its successors." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WLY8PPRH?page=6}{Rosenberg 2018:16})
\par
"In the natural sciences, the greatest obstacle to advancement has been conceptual, not factual; that is, advances have oen been the result of realizing that our commonsense descriptive categories needed to be changed because they were a barrier to discovering generalizations. Thus, the Newtonian revolution was the result of realizing that commonsense notions about change, forces, motion, and the nature of space needed to be replaced if we were to uncover the real laws of motion." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WLY8PPRH?page=10}{Rosenberg 2018:20})
\par
"Indeed, the difference between a "kindterm" like gold, which reflects real divisions in nature, and one like fake gold, which does not, is that there are laws about the former and not the latter. Philosophers call the kindterms that figure in laws "natural kinds." The search for generalizations and laws in science is at the same time a search for these natural kinds." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WLY8PPRH?page=12}{Rosenberg 2018:22})
\par
"the charge that the social sciences have made less progress than the natural sciences is oen said to rest on a myopic absolutism—a view that improperly generalizes from the methodological recipes of the obsolete paradigm of Newtonian physics" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WLY8PPRH?page=15}{Rosenberg 2018:25})},

In consequence, it is also generally recognized that game theory is an important tool for studying these phenomena.

The individualistic philosophical bias in Western social ontology makes signaling seem more challenging than it really is, and thus focuses attention on theoretical problems – for example, coordination on lexical meaning – that actual evolution did not need to solve by improving humans’ strategic or social intelligence relative to the endowments of other primates. At the same time, issues of genuine evolutionary significance related to language, especially those around the tensions between individual and collective agency, and around intergenerational accumulation of knowledge, are obscured. This in turn leads to underestimation of the potential contribution that game theory can make to enlightening models of the evolution of human language.

"Social behavior involves coordination, and coordination is such a complicated set of processes that wherever one cannot abstract away from it, one enters into a distinct domain of modeling problems." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=1}{Ross 2012:1})
\par
"However, game theory has given precision and detail to a key point that Adam Smith broadly grasped: Except in the unusual case of zero-sum games competition is not the opposite of coordination, but is mediated by it." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=2}{Ross 2012:2})
\par
"A key insight of Schelling's was that players' knowledge of one another's strategy sets and utility functions, no matter how complete, is insu= cient for e= cient coordination in many games that have multiple equilibria. Players should also model one another's recursive belief structures, using whatever knowledge they happen to possess about one another's behavioral track records and exposure to data, in search of information bases for coordination of expectations." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=2}{Ross 2012:2})

"Focal points are products of shared psychology and cultural convergence. 8 ere is no reason to expect that a theory of rationality will have anything to say about their provenance, though it has much to say about their exploitation." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=2}{Ross 2012:2})
\par
"Two general principles for the foundations of social science have been widely absorbed from considerations of stylized problems such as battle of the sexes. First, coordination is intrinsically diA cult due to multiplicity of equilibria in most interactions. Second, many features of social organization evolve and stabilize because they ease this diA culty. 7 ese principles have been widely put to work at both local and general levels of explanation. On the local level, they are oB en applied to explain speci8 c social phenomena. For example, Young ( =CC5 ) uses them to explain the evolution of traA c rules and norms governing contracts between landlords and sharecroppers. More broadly, they have been used to explain the general phenomenon of co-evolved sociality and extreme cognitive-behavioral plasticity—that is, intelligence—in humans." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=3}{Ross 2012:3})
\par
"7 e two principles as stated above are broadly correct, but they are crude. First, they do not distinguish between di8 erent ways in which coordination problems might be thought to be di9 cult, which may in turn imply di8 erent solution mechanisms that interact with one another in human social structures and evolution. Second, they are silent on the di8 erent possible dynamic trajectories by which coordination problems and socialization might drive one another. Did socialization come : rst in hominid evolution, giving rise to complex coordination problems that higher intelligence then evolved to solve? Or, in light of the importance of social norms and conventions for selecting focal points in coordination games, did intelligence generate coordination problems to which increasingly complex social structures are adaptations?" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=4}{Ross 2012:4})
\par
"social intelligence hypothesis, ? rst articulated by Humphrey ( ;@A7 ). According to this hypothesis, noneuscial sociality and intelligence coevolve because the main selection pressure that gives rise to advanced cognitive facility in various species is the value to individuals of remembering particular social colleagues' identities, along with their varying track records of reciprocal cooperation and tendencies to engage in con{$<$} ict over mates, food, status, and other resources. A later, somewhat more speci? c version of the proposal is the so-called Machiavellian hypothesis, which emphasizes the importance of keeping track of who is in whose collation of alliances for the sake of political success in maintaining status and rank (Byrne and Whiten ;@66 , Whiten and Byrne ;@@A )." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=6}{Ross 2012:6})
\par
"A key commitment of social intelligence theory is that sociality and intelligence co evolve. 9 is is encapsulated in the relevant idea of sociality at play in the : rst place. Many relatively unintelligent animals cluster together in herds for protection from predators, but do not enter into complex relationships with speci: c individuals as de: ned by properties other than consanguinity relationships (Ross 78;8 ). A group of organisms constitutes a society , as opposed to a herd, when (i) the expected individual : tness of each organism is partly a function of the di{$<$} erential : tness of the group, (ii) individuals are to some extent restricted, by factors going beyond geographical proximity or physical barriers, in their ability to switch groups, (iii) most group members are associated with some other members, aside from mates, direct ancestors, and direct descendants, in ways that in= uence their expected : tness, and (iv) random re-permutations of the individuals : guring in these withingroup associations would produce wide variations in : tness distributions a{$>$} er sex and age di{$<$} erences are controlled for. 9 ese properties give rise to complex interdependence that implies need for coordination." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=7}{Ross 2012:7})
\par
"From the game-theoretic perspective, we can identify two approaches to cognitively representing coordination dynamics in sets of interacting individuals with distinctive strategic dispositions. One approach simply stores and updates lists of condition-action pairs. 9 us, for example, an animal might tag each conspeci: c with which it has a strategic relationship with labels such as "reciprocated cooperation last time" or "failed to reciprocate cooperation last time." Updating of such tags on each episode of interaction could readily facilitate use of simple but relatively robust strategies such as tit for tat in coordination games with competitive aspects. Again, however, it is not clear that storing and using lists requires unusual intelligence." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=7}{Ross 2012:7})
\par
"9 e alternative approach to cognitively controlling one's own interactive dynamics with speci: c individuals is to compute representations of, and solutions to, extensive-form games. 9 is might be done using heuristics that are less reliably accurate and powerful than a game theorist's trees or sets of equations, but on any implementation it is likely to require considerable neural processing resources." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=7}{Ross 2012:7})
\par
"However, for the analyst, 7 eshing out the Machiavellian or social brain hypotheses using this cognitive conjecture faces two serious empirical problems. First, observed instances of so-called reciprocal altruism among nonhuman animals are largely limited to interactions most naturally characterized using binary strategy sets (e.g., regurgitate blood for another vampire bat or don't; guard another's o8 spring or ignore them) and repeated iterations of identical stage games. It is unclear in such cases why representation of extensive-form games would have any advantages over, or be behaviorally distinguishable from, simple condition-action list storage. Second, numerous experiments show that people do not, except a9 er substantial situational training (Kagel and Levin :;;; ; List and Lucking-Reiley {$<$}=={$<$} ; Levitt, List, and Sado8 {$<$}=:: ), choose strategies using the kind of backward-induction logic that game theorists rely upon for solving extensive-form games. A particularly persuasive demonstration of this, using MOUSELAB, is given by Camerer et al. ( :;;{$>$} ). And it is unlikely that any nonhuman animals are better theoretical strategists than humans." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=8}{Ross 2012:8})
\par
"A research program initiated by Paul Glimcher and collaborators (see Glimcher {$<$}=={$>$}a ), based on single-cell recordings in monkeys, strongly suggests that, at least in primate brains, individual neurons in the circuit that estimates comparative reward values directly compute statistical variations in choice that track Nash equilibrium (NE) mixtures." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=8}{Ross 2012:8})
\par
": e 7 ndings in monkeys as reviewed above go some way toward answering this objection. All primate—and, for that, mammalian—midbrain reward systems are anatomically alike, and most evidence to date at least weakly supports functional similarity. : us the single-cell work with monkeys is evidence that people's brains contain neuronal groups that are, in e9 ect, automatic mixed-strategy equilibrium calculators."

"Imitation, especially of the fully mimetic variety that does not require the immediate presence of the imitated party's behavior, is the simplest and most direct possible vehicle for coordination." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=14}{Ross 2012:14})

"Ofek builds a case that development of the metabolically expensive brain required dietary shi{$>$} s that could only be supported by the development of specialization of labor and exchange across bands. 7 e earliest tradables produced by specialist producers, Ofek suggests, were ; remaintenance services ? and sheep and goat herding. Cross-band exchange in turn required the partial displacement of natural xenophobic violence by diplomacy, thus promoting social intelligence and the enhanced strategic competence in which it partly consists."

"7 e evolution of modern societies is characterized by dizzying acceleration in the special human capacity for niche construction; by their behavior traders don't merely adapt to markets, but change their structures. 7 is raises the following problem for the game modeler. If, as we should expect to be typical, people approach their strategic interactions with both asymmetric information and the ability to exploit this information to dynamically in8 uence outcome spaces, why and how should we imagine that agents converge on a shared model of outcomes? Such convergence is a necessary condition on our being able to say anything about players' levels of knowledge of the structure of their games." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=17}{Ross 2012:17})
\par
"7 is hierarchy of global and local games, based on di{$<$} erent scales of analysis where both time and agency are concerned, allows for qualitative dynamics in which agents disposed to contrarian behavior give other agents incentive to favor them because they thereby reduce the relative size of the basin of attraction of overconvergence in the space of evolutionary global games. Put in plainer terms, where the dynamic of socialization leads to evolutionary competition among groups that have developed market exchange and specialization of labor, pressure can arise that favors the cultivation of a form of socialized individuality that is distinct from genetic individuality. 7 e individuality in question is socialized because it is a set of dispositions to favor certain strategies over others in global games; thus it presupposes and arises from complex sociality." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=20}{Ross 2012:20})
\par
"Socialized individuals are not merely genetic individuals who can refer to themselves, as fantasized by thinkers in the venerable Western philosophical tradition of social atomism. Normal human individuals are adaptations to social pressures to conform to prevailing norms but, within those limits, to cultivate patterns of distinctive, re-recognizable (and therefore relatively predictable) self-models that govern their own behavior. Such selves can perform the unique trick, valuable only in the context of the unusual human ecological strategy, of facilitating division of labor within novel and creative group enterprises. It was likely our ancestors' capacity for such joint creativity that allowed us to survive the concertina of glacial advances and retreats during our species' early career—and, by standard Darwinian logic, those same pressures that made us the unique virtuosos of coordination that we are." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PDFRI6LZ?page=20}{Ross 2012:20})
\par
"8 e evolution of fully symbolic representation in people was enormously important to intergenerational coordination that, by conserving cultural and technological discoveries, accelerated human niche construction. But this is not the sort of basic coordination on which philosophers inspired by game theory—for example, Lewis ( 6;{$>$}; ) and Skyrms ( 6;;{$>$} , 9565 )—have so far concentrated."

"As argued by a range of theorists including Bruner ( 6;;9 , 9559 ), Dennett ( 6;;6 ), Turner ( 6;;? ), and Ross ( 9554 , 955: ), a crucial evolved basis for guiding socialized individuality, and consequent approximate equilibria in networks of behavioral expectations, are common perceptions of narrative coherence. People insist that others with whom they enter into coordination exercises tell dramatically structured, publicly rati7 able stories about themselves and conform their behavior to these stories. 8 is enables not only public predictability, but, for organisms with enormous information-processing devices that are largely opaque to their direct inspection, selfpredictability (Dennett 6;;6 )."

  abstract = {Complex networks arise in many domains and often represent phenomena such as brain activity, social relationships, molecular interactions, hyperlinks, and re-tweets. In this work, we study the problem of predicting the category (domain) of arbitrary networks. This includes complex networks from different domains as well as synthetically generated graphs from six different network models. We formulate this problem as a multiclass classification problem and learn a model to predict the domain of a new previously unseen network using only a small set of simple structural features. The model is able to accurately predict the domain of arbitrary networks from 17 different domains with 95.7\% accuracy. This work makes two important findings. First, our results indicate that complex networks from various domains have distinct structural properties that allow us to predict with high accuracy the category of a new previously unseen network. Second, synthetic graphs are trivial to classify as the classification model can predict with near-certainty the graph model used to generate it. Overall, the results demonstrate that networks drawn from different domains and graph models are distinguishable using a few simple structural features.}

Little is known, however, about how the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which subserves decision-making, combines these quantities. Here, using computational modelling and neuroimaging, we show that the ventromedial PFC encodes both reward expectations and proper beliefs about reward contingencies, while the dorsomedial PFC combines these quantities and guides choices that are at variance with those predicted by optimal decision theory: instead of integrating reward expectations with beliefs, the dorsomedial PFC built context-dependent reward expectations commensurable to beliefs and used these quantities as two concurrent appetitive components, driving choices. This neural mechanism accounts for well-known risk aversion effects in human decision-making. The results reveal that the irrationality of human choices commonly theorized as deriving from optimal computations over false beliefs, actually stems from suboptimal neural heuristics over rational beliefs about reward contingencies.},

Generally, Epstein argues that for an improvement in the methodology of social science we must adopt social ontology as the foundation of social sciences; that is, the standing microfoundationalist debate could be solved by fixing economics’ ontology. However, as I show in this paper, fixing the social ontology prior to the process of model construction is optional instead of necessary and that metaphysical-ontological commitments are often the outcome of model construction, not its starting point. By focusing on the practice of modeling in economics the paper provides a useful inroad into the debate about the role of metaphysics in the natural and social sciences more generally.},

Instead they are seeking to provide (non‐reductive) microfoundations with which they can corroborate and make understandable the connection between macrosocial phenomena. In order to do so a theory (or theories) of human action is required. One such theory, rational choice theory (RCT), has long been viewed with strong suspicion in sociology. I show such suspicion to be partially justified. RCT cannot be a general theory of social behaviour. Nonetheless, there are important insights in various versions of RCT that should not be discarded. In order to improve upon RCT and move toward a more unified or integrative theory of action social‐psychological research has to be taken note of. I demonstrate how dual‐process theories and the research on heuristics can help sociologists move beyond RCT without contradicting some of its more basic insights.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Unlike traditional game theory models, which assume that all players are fully rational and have complete knowledge of details of the game, evolutionary models assume that people choose their strategies through a trial-and-error learning process in which they gradually discover that some strategies work better than others. In games that are repeated many times, low-payoff strategies tend to be weeded out, and an equilibrium may emerge.Larry Samuelson has been one of the main contributors to the evolutionary game theory literature. In Evolutionary Games and Equilibrium Selection, he examines the interplay between evolutionary game theory and the equilibrium selection problem in noncooperative games. After providing an overview of the basic issues of game theory and a presentation of the basic models, the book addresses evolutionary stability, the dynamics of sample paths, the ultimatum game, drift, noise, backward and forward induction, and strict Nash equilibria.},

"While we consider it an important desideratum for models of cognitive mechanisms to be grounded in accounts of neural and other physical structures, we believe that it would be problematic to require all cognitive explanations of social phenomena to be couched in neural-physical terms. First, this is because such a requirement would be too demanding, as we often do not know in detail what physical mechanisms realize complex cultural representations (Lizardo et al., 2020). Second, 'full physical grounding' may not always even be necessary, since idealized mechanistic models may serve many explanatory purposes on a greater level of abstraction (Thomson-Jones, 2005). Third, proponents of '4e-cognition' or 'wide cognition' (e.g. Clark, 2008; Milkowski, 2013; Turner, 2018) have argued that some cognitive mechanisms may extend beyond the brains of individuals to the extremities of their bodies and some features of the material environment. They have accordingly argued that cognition is embodied (Clark, 1997; Damasio, 2000; Gallagher, 2005), embedded (Brooks, 1999; Huebner, 2013), materially and socially extended or distributed (Clark \& Chalmers, 1998; Hutchins, 1995; Menary, 2010; Sutton et al., 2010) and enactive (De Jaegher \& Di Paolo, 2007; Thompson, 2007; Varela et al., 1991), rather than a purely intracranial affair."

"Drawing on William Bechtel (2009), we propose that mechanistic explanations satisfying the criteria outlined in this section can be formulated by answering the following four questions, which are couched in terms of the intuitive visual metaphors of 'looking at' the phenomenon to be explained, 'looking down' at the parts and activities that give rise to the phenomenon, 'looking around' at the organization and interactions of these parts, and 'looking up' at the environment in which the mechanism operates (for a similar classification, see Craver \& Darden, 2013: 163): 1) What is the phenomenon to be explained ('looking at')? 2) What are the relevant entities and their activities ('looking down')? 3) What are the organization and interactions of these entities and activities through which they contribute to the phenomenon ('looking around')? 4) What is the environment in which the mechanism is situated and how does it affect its functioning ('looking up')?"

"Knoblich and colleagues (2011) discuss four cognitive mechanisms for emergent coordination, which they refer to as entrainment, common object-affordances, perceptionaction matching, and action simulation. Entrainment refers to the behaviors of two or more individuals becoming synchronized when they are performing the same action or when they receive the same auditory, visual or haptic information (Knoblich et al., 2011: 66), as when two individuals in adjacent rocking chairs involuntarily adjust their rhythms to one another (Richardson et al., 2007). Common object affordances refers to objects that can be manipulated by two or more individuals in ways in which they cannot be manipulated by one individual acting alone, such as a see-saw or a two-handled saw (cf. Gibson, 1977). Perception-action matching refers to mechanisms that induce an individual to perform similar actions as she has observed another individual performing, either by way of the mirror neuron system in the lateral intraparietal area and the ventral intraparietal area of the human brain (Gallese \& Goldman, 1998; Rizzolatti \& Sinigaglia, 2010) or via ideomotor mechanisms of action control (Hommel et al., 2001; Prinz, 1997). Action simulation refers to an individual using her own action control system to predict what the other" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HI484R9U?page=9}{Sarkia et al 2020:588})

\par
"While emergent coordination is explained primarily by sub-intentional mechanisms of action control, planned coordination is explained by reference to explicit mental representations that are accessible to intentional awareness. Different types and degrees of planned coordination may be distinguished on the basis of the extent to which they involve explicit representations of a common goal, other individuals in a joint action, and/or the division of tasks between the participants (Knoblich et al., 2011; Vesper et al., 2010). Minimal forms of planned coordination may involve only partial representations of some of these features, while cognitively sophisticated forms of planned coordination involve detailed representations of all of them (Vesper et al., 2010). Moreover, some of these aspects of planned coordination may be left open to be filled in by step-by-step joint deliberation as the activity progresses (Bratman, 2014), or by synchronic forms of emergent coordination that operate at the moment the individuals are acting together. Finally, planned coordination may involve deliberate attempts to facilitate coordination by means of coordination smoothers, such as exaggerated hand movements or the adoption of a particular, suggestive gesture (Vesper et al., 2010; 2016)."

"Developmental social psychologists and evolutionary anthropologists study what cognitive capacities and motivations set apart human infants from the great apes, and the developmental stages through which these capacities and motivations emerge in human ontogeny. This may be understood as an answer to Bechtel's first question concerning the phenomenon that we are looking at (e.g. distinguishing social games from the types of instrumental coordination tasks that chimpanzees are more adept at solving (Warneken et al., 2006)), and his fourth question concerning the ways in which they operate in particular environments (e.g. whether chimpanzees coordinate in a different manner with human partners in the laboratory than with their conspecifics in the wild (see Tomasello, 2011)). By contrast, cognitive scientists address Bechtel's second and third questions by attempting to identify what cognitive mechanisms (e.g. common object affordances, entrainment, and action simulation) make the operation of these species-typical capacities and motivations for social coordination possible. In addition, social scientists may also address further questions about the outcomes of interpersonal social coordination, e.g. by studying complex social networks that are formed when people coordinate their interactions (Borgatti et al., 2009; Watts, 2004)."

This claim is defended through a detailed case study and revisionary interpretation of Raimo Tuomela’s account of the we-perspective. My interpretation is grounded in Ronald Giere’s account of scientific models, and argued to be compatible with, but less demanding than Tuomela’s own description of his account as a philosophical theory of the social world. My approach is also suggested to be applicable to many (but not necessarily all) other methodologically naturalist accounts of collective intentionality and social ontology.},

  abstract = {Metaphysics has undergone two major innovations in recent decades. First, naturalistic metaphysicians have argued that our best science provides an important source of evidence for metaphysical theories. Second, social metaphysicians have begun to explore the nature of social entities such as groups, institutions, and social categories. Surprisingly, these projects have largely kept their distance from one another. Katherine Hawley has recently argued that, unlike the natural sciences, the social sciences are not sufficiently successful to provide evidence about the metaphysical nature of social entities. By contrast, I defend an optimistic view of naturalistic social metaphysics. Drawing on a case study of research into contextual effects in social epidemiology, I show that social science can provide a valuable evidence for social metaphysicians.},

Much of this work has been largely dissociated from actual social science, a complaint that has been raised by several writers (Guala 2007; Lauer 2017; Lohse 2017). While the prospect of incorporating more social science into social ontology is appealing, it is easier said than done." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5MXCGBPD?page=3}{Saunders 2020:140})
\par
"Some scientific theories turn out to be false and others are useful fictions. In either case, those theories refer to entities that do not exist and are poor guides to metaphysics. Instead, we have to have some criteria which indicate which theories are likely to be true in order to reliably make metaphysical inferences. A great deal of work in the scientific realism literature has been dedicated to elaborating these criteria (Chakravartty 2007; Ladyman et al. 2007; Psillos 1999; Schindler 2018; Worral 1989). Two conditions have broad support across several accounts—we should believe in theories that both successfully make novel predictions and are mature." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5MXCGBPD?page=3}{Saunders 2020:140})
\par
"Hawley aims to show that social science just does not achieve the level of success needed to justify realist inferences. It is both immature and fails to make successful novel predictions. Here are her two arguments: a. Novel predictions—social science enjoys few, if any, novel predictive success stories. Its theories merely accommodate existing data. But it is easy to get a false theory to fit a given body of data. Only when a theory is able to successfully predict novel phenomena can we know it is true. Even if there are some isolated social scientific successes, "there are no social analogues of the gravitational waves or Higgs boson" (Hawley 2018, 5). b. Maturity—social science is characterized by widespread diversity in methods, theories, schools of thoughts, and explanations. Worse, the social sciences will often "treat the same phenomena in different and" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5MXCGBPD?page=4}{Saunders 2020:141})
\par
"142 Philosophy of the Social Sciences 50(2) seemingly incompatible ways" (Hawley 2018, 4). Those explanations will employ different interpretations of key theoretical terms and assign wildly different weights to those variables. Social explanations are too unstable to serve as the basis for reliable metaphysical theorizing." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5MXCGBPD?page=5}{Saunders 2020:142})
\par
"To show that theories in social science are seriously underdetermined, one has to show that there are multiple incompatible theories that are all consistent with the evidence." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5MXCGBPD?page=9}{Saunders 2020:146})
\par
"However, at this point a further worry may arise—does our best social science have anything interesting to say about social ontology? There are two, closely related worries. First, social science may not be fine-grained enough to adjudicate between views in social ontology. The fact that the income inequality hypothesis is successful does not directly tell metaphysicians what social objects exist. Second, if reductionist explanations of the income inequality hypothesis are viable, then it may not have anything to say about social objects. There is a view among some philosophers and social scientists that only individuals exist (Demeulenaere 2011). They hold that social objects are fully dispensable. Novel predictive success is not enough if our best social scientific theories quantify over objects that we have good reason to eliminate."

  abstract = {Influence maximization deals with the problem of identifying {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}k{$<$}/em{$>$}-size subset of nodes in a social network that can maximize the influence spread in the network. In this paper, the problem of influence maximization using two aspects, node connectivity and node activity level, has been studied. To measure node connectivity, the widely popular and intuitive measure of out-degree of node has been used, and for node activity, node's past interactions have been taken into consideration. For studying influence spread, two activity-based diffusion models, namely {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}Activity-based Independent Cascade{$<$}/em{$>~$}model and {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}Activity-based Linear Threshold{$<$}/em{$>~$}model, have been proposed in which influence propagation is driven by a node's activity that it has actually performed in the past. Activity-based models aim at studying influence spread by incorporating a more realistic aspect corresponding to user behavior. Motivated by the belief that activity is as important as connectivity, {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}UAC-Rank{$<$}/em{$>$} algorithm for the identification of initial adopters has been proposed.}

By combining the concepts of emergence and algorithmic information theory in a thought experiment, employing a basic nonlinear process, it is shown that epistemologically emergent properties may develop in a physical system. Turning to the significantly more complex neural network of the brain it is subsequently argued that consciousness is epistemologically emergent. Thus reductionist understanding of consciousness appears not possible; the mind–body problem does not have a reductionist solution. The ontologically emergent character of consciousness is then identified from a combinatorial analysis relating to universal limits set by quantum mechanics, implying that consciousness is fundamentally irreducible to low-level phenomena.}

Hawley raises the question: If we are sympathetic to the project of naturalising metaphysics, how should we approach the metaphysics of the social world? She proceeds by discussing three approaches to social metaphysics: (SM-1) inference to the best explanation (IBE) from current social science, (SM-2) descriptive conceptual analysis, and (SM-3) normative, especially ‘ameliorative’ projects. At the end of her discussion, she reaches a rather pessimistic conclusion, especially as regards the IBE approach: “a number of phenomena indicate that the prospects for securely basing social metaphysics via inference to the best explanation from social science are currently faint. […] We need to look elsewhere if we are to develop a metaphysics of the social world.” In my comments on her paper, I try to re-animate the program of an inductive metaphysics by defending the idea that the method of inference to the best explanation (IBE method) should be the central method of justification for metaphysics in general and for social metaphysics in particular.},

\par
"It is here that focal points play a major role, according to Schelling. With reference to Gestalt-psychology, Schelling points out that it seems to be part of human nature to look for and recognize patterns (Schelling 1960: 104; cf. also Ayson 2004: Ch. 6). Hence, if we ensure that we behave in accordance with observable patterns, we may expect our opponent to recognize and understand that pattern and to thus deduce the limits of our intentions."

"If Schelling's theory is correct, the bargaining outcome is thus determined by features that have nothing to do with material benefit, tactical advantage or relative military strength; indeed, it is determined by features that are entirely arbitrary from a (game) theoretical point of view."

"'that which draws attention'—that which is salient—is highly dependent on context. A focal point solution is precisely that: a solution to a specific problem. Hence, the nature of the problem also influences what stands out and draws attention." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4NJDLBH?page=37}{Schuessler and van der Rijt 2019:37})
\par
"If the problem to be resolved is a different one, or if the party one is interacting with is different (e.g. one has a shared history or shared culture), then what counts as likely to stand out to both may also differ."

\par
"To explain focal point coordination, Bacharach emphasizes a dimension of choice situations that game theory often neglects. This is the fact that, strictly speaking, decision makers do not necessarily view situations in the same way as modelers or theoreticians view them. Specifically, decision makers may not describe the option set in the same ways as theoreticians would describe them. This has important consequences, as decision makers can only choose an option from the option set as they perceive it. Hence, when this differs from the way the theorist has modelled the situation, the theorist's predictions will be off." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4NJDLBH?page=47}{Schuessler and van der Rijt 2019:47})
\par
"We do not need to deny that there is an objective reality underlying people's choice situations, but it is a well-established fact of psychology that our brains selectively filter the input we receive from our senses. Hence, decision makers will always be limited to their perception of a problem when they navigate their way through them. The way of perceiving a situation one finds oneself in (and the choices one has in it) is what Bacharach refers to as a frame.12 Thus, when we seek to model rational decision making, we need to model it by taking into account the agents' frames, for it is within these frames that they must make their decisions." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4NJDLBH?page=47}{Schuessler and van der Rijt 2019:47})
\par
"For Bacharach, we do not choose how we experience the world, even if there are different ways in which we can experience it. Which way we happen to experience a situation—which frame we use—is, according to Bacharach, determined by our psychology. Our minds are geared in such a way that we can use different frames to cope with different problems, but which frame our brains selects is more of an automatic response that is triggered by certain aspects of our circumstances that happen to attract our attention than it is a conscious or deliberate choice." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4NJDLBH?page=48}{Schuessler and van der Rijt 2019:48})
\par
"Bacharach advocates understanding focal points as triggers for certain frames. Thus, if a given aspect of a situation stands out, our minds are highly aware of these aspects and select a frame based on these outstanding aspects (they are, in a way, the first thing our minds focus on). This occurs completely automatically and is beyond our control, but nonetheless influences our position toward the problems we encounter." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4NJDLBH?page=48}{Schuessler and van der Rijt 2019:48})
\par
"Normal persons have absolutely no problem solving such coordination problems and fairly reliably play Hi. Game theory, however, is unable to distinguish between the two strategies Hi-Hi and Lo-Lo, as they are both Nash equilibria." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4NJDLBH?page=48}{Schuessler and van der Rijt 2019:48})
\par
"Where standard game theory assumes each person to view this problem (as he would every problem) as a situation in which he must try to maximize his individual payoff, this is actually not how we try to resolve such problems. Instead, so Bacharach purports, the obvious common interest and mutual dependency leads us to adopt a "we-frame". Rather than trying to solve the problem 'How can I maximize my pay-off?', we tend to focus on the question 'How can we maximize our payoff?'. The answer to this question is, of course, very easy: we maximize our payoff by playing Hi-Hi. Having determined that, it is also clear to each player what he must do to achieve that goal: play Hi." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4NJDLBH?page=49}{Schuessler and van der Rijt 2019:49})
\par
"Unlike Bacharach, however, Sugden is not particularly interested in showing that team reasoning is a valid mode of reasoning and in determining if and when individuals ought to engage in it. Instead, Sugden focuses more on the question whether it adequately describes a mode of reasoning that people actually use, whether they ought to or not (see Bacharach 2006: xxii). When it comes to focal points and salience, Sugden's interest is primarily focused on the development of a descriptively adequate analysis of the way(s) they are used by real world people. As a result, Sugden limits the pretentions of decision theory and emphasizes the importance of empirical research." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4NJDLBH?page=50}{Schuessler and van der Rijt 2019:50})
\par
"In his critique of standard game theory, Sugden is adamant that the way people experience their situation and the options they have (what he calls the 'labelling of options' (Sugden 1995; cf. also Mehta et al. 1994) must be taken into account to adequately describe the way people behave in decision problems, but by itself that does not enable us to decide which of the various explanations is most accurate." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4NJDLBH?page=53}{Schuessler and van der Rijt 2019:53})
\par
"To determine which of these competing ways of reasoning people actually use, Sugden and his collaborators developed a number of ingenious empirical tests (Bardsley et al. 2010). The results of these tests indicate that people actually engage in both these types of reasoning. Thus, both theories of focal point coordination are supported by empirical facts. People sometimes engage in team reasoning, and other times in a mode of reasoning that better corresponds to cognitive hierarchy theory. Precisely what makes them choose which mode of reasoning still remains a largely open question, but the tests do indicate that subtle differences in context can be sufficient to make people switch from one mode of reasoning to another."

"Empirical evidence corroborates different explanations of focal point coordination. Thus, it seems that focality and salience affect the behavior of persons in different ways and/or at different levels. Perhaps the most important finding, however, is the sensitivity of these issues to the given context." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/J4NJDLBH?page=54}{Schuessler and van der Rijt 2019:54})},

The analysis of functional traits of evolutionary systems which I give in Sect. 7.2 is grounded on these assumptions. The evolutionary explanation of the emergence of functions leads me to an abstract schema of evolutionary explanations that is based on iterations of variation and selection processes. In the final Sect. 7.3, it is shown, at hand of the problem of explaining evolutionary macrotransformation, that abstract evolutionary explanations are considered as inadequate by evolutionary scientists as long as not at least some plausible mechanism can be given, both for the production of complex variations and for their selection.},

The goal of this paper is to defend the theory of generalized evolution (GE) against criticisms by laying down its theoretical principles and their applications in a unified way. Section 2 develops GE theory and its realization in biological evolution (BE) and cultural evolution (CE). The core of GE theory consists of the three Darwinian principles together with the models of population dynamics (PD). Section 3 reconstructs the most important differences between BE and CE. While BE is predominantly based on the replication of genes, CE is based on the reproduction of memes. Memes are understood as the informational “software” of human brains transmitted through social learning processes. The ontology of memes and the concept of cultural fitness is carved out and refined. Finally, section 4 articulates the minimal ontological assumptions of GE theory and the quantitative principles of generalized PD that unify biological PD and evolutionary game theory.},

  abstract = {Classical economic models are predicated on the idea that the ultimate aim of choice is to maximize utility or reward. In contrast, an alternative perspective highlights the fact that adaptive behavior requires agents’ to model their environment and minimize surprise about the states they frequent. We propose that choice behavior can be more accurately accounted for by surprise minimization compared to reward or utility maximization alone. Minimizing surprise makes a prediction at variance with expected utility models; namely, that in addition to attaining valuable states, agents attempt to maximize the entropy over outcomes and thus ‘keep their options open’. We tested this prediction using a simple binary choice paradigm and show that human decision-making is better explained by surprise minimization compared to utility maximization. Furthermore, we replicated this entropy-seeking behavior in a control task with no explicit utilities. These findings highlight a limitation of purely economic motivations in explaining choice behavior and instead emphasize the importance of belief-based motivations.},

Put briefly, ultimate explanations are concerned with why a behavior exists, and proximate explanations are concerned with how it works. These two types of explanation are complementary and the distinction is critical to evolutionary explanation. We are concerned that they have become conflated in some areas of the evolutionary literature on human behavior. This article brings attention to these issues. We focus on three specific areas: the evolution of cooperation, transmitted culture, and epigenetics. We do this to avoid confusion and wasted effort—dangers that are particularly acute in interdisciplinary research.

Now he offers a profound understanding of how we create a social reality--a reality of money, property, governments, marriages, stock markets and cocktail parties. The paradox he addresses in Making the Social World is that these facts only exist because we think they exist and yet they have an objective existence. Continuing a line of investigation begun in his earlier book The Construction of Social Reality, Searle identifies the precise role of language in the creation of all "institutional facts." His aim is to show how mind, language and civilization are natural products of the basic facts of the physical world described by physics, chemistry and biology. Searle explains how a single linguistic operation, repeated over and over, is used to create and maintain the elaborate structures of human social institutions. These institutions serve to create and distribute power relations that are pervasive and often invisible. These power relations motivate human actions in a way that provides the glue that holds human civilization together. Searle then applies the account to show how it relates to human rationality, the freedom of the will, the nature of political power and the existence of universal human rights. In the course of his explication, he asks whether robots can have institutions, why the threat of force so often lies behind institutions, and he denies that there can be such a thing as a "state of nature" for language-using human beings.},

The tight interpersonal coordination that characterizes joint actions is achieved through processes that help with preparing for joint action as well as processes that are active while joint actions are being performed. To prepare for joint action, partners form representations of each other’s actions and tasks and the relation between them. This enables them to predict each other’s upcoming actions, which, in turn, facilitates coordination. While performing joint actions, partners’ coordination is maintained by (a) monitoring whether individual and joint outcomes correspond to what was planned, (b) predicting partners’ action parameters on the basis of familiarity with their individual actions, (c) communicating task-relevant information unknown to partners in an action-based fashion, and (d) relying on coupling of predictions through dense perceptual-information flow between coactors. The next challenge for the field of joint action is to generate an integrated perspective that links coordination mechanisms to normative, evolutionary, and communicative frameworks.},

Developing a typology based upon the existing literature, we identify three branches of cognitive sociology in France. The first was initiated by Raymond Boudon, one of the scholars most responsible for popularizing the area, who envisioned cognitive sociology as helping delineate the role of beliefs in rational action. Second, another group of researchers seeks to found sociology upon a naturalistic basis, thus drawing upon the disciplines constitutive of cognitive science (e.g., psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and cognitive anthropology). Finally, the third approach to cognitive sociology in France takes inspiration from linguistics as a foundation for sociological investigations. We conclude the paper by discussing the relationship between these three sub-fields and by examining the relationship between French and American cognitive sociologies in order to identify fruitful directions for future research.},

First it states that the informational view which dominates the study of animal communication leads to cut apart the biological, the cognitive and the social parts of social communication. When it comes to human nonverbal communication, it is difficult then to articulate its biological and the cultural dimensions. Following Ingold I argue that in order to go beyond the “natural pattern vs cultural rules or meaning” conception of human nonverbal communication, we need to rely on a relational view. But what is a relational view in the study of communication? In the final part of the paper, I suggest that social relationships are both subjective and objective entities and, drawing on an original paper by Kaufmann and Clément (2008, in press), I offer a hypothesis on how social communication could operate to objectively and subjectively organize the construction of social relationships.},

The ‘raptor alarms’ of starlings and vervet monkeys are so called because they are given exclusively to avian species that attack from the air. In contrast, while vervets give ‘leopard alarms’ to a narrow array of terrestrial predators, starlings give terrestrial predator alarms to a wide variety of species, including some birds. Habituation experiments demonstrate that monkeys compare vocalizations according to their referents, not just their acoustic properties: vervets who learned to ignore playback of a starling's raptor alarm subsequently also ignored playback of a vervet's eagle alarm. Experiments also demonstrate that vervets are sensitive to the breadth of referential specificity exhibited by different calls. Subjects who learned to ignore playback of a starling terrestrial predator alarm subsequently also ignored playback of both vervet leopard and vervet raptor alarms.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of communication and its evolution has advanced significantly through the study of simple models involving interacting senders and receivers of signals. Many theorists have thought that the resources of mathematical information theory are all that are needed to capture the meaning or content that is being communicated in these systems. However, the way theorists routinely talk about the models implicitly draws on a conception of content that is richer than bare informational content, especially in contexts where false content is important. This article shows that this concept can be made precise by defining a notion of functional content that captures the degree to which different states of the world are involved in stabilizing senders’ and receivers’ use of a signal at equilibrium. A series of case studies is used to contrast functional content with informational content, and to illustrate the explanatory role and limitations of this definition of functional content. 1{$\quad$}Introduction 2{$\quad$}Modelling Framework 3{$\quad$}Two Kinds of Content {$\quad\quad$}3.1{$\quad$}Informational content {$\quad\quad$}3.2{$\quad$}Functional content 4{$\quad$}Cases {$\quad\quad$}4.1{$\quad$}Case 1: Simplest case {$\quad\quad$}4.2{$\quad$}Case 2: Partial pooling {$\quad\quad$}4.3{$\quad$}Case 3: Bottleneck {$\quad\quad$}4.4{$\quad$}Case 4: Partial common interest {$\quad\quad$}4.5{$\quad$}Case 5: Deception {$\quad\quad$}4.6{$\quad$}Case 6: A further problem arising from divergent interests 5{$\quad$}Discussion Appendix},

  abstract = {Information, entropy, probability: these three terms are closely interconnected in the prevalent understanding of statistical mechanics, both when this field is taught to students at an introductory level and in advanced research into the field's foundations. This paper examines the interconnection between these three notions in light of recent research in the foundations of statistical mechanics. It disentangles these concepts and highlights their differences, at the same time explaining why they came to be so closely linked in the literature. In the literature the term 'information' is often linked to entropy and probability in discussions of Maxwell's Demon and its attempted exorcism by the Landauer-Bennett thesis, and in analyses of the spin echo experiments. The direction taken in the present paper is a different one. Here we discuss the statistical mechanical underpinning of the notions of probability and entropy, and this constructive approach shows that information plays no fundamental role in these concepts, although it can be conveniently used in a sense that we shall specify.}

In the process of ethnographic observation of the practices, the object of study was found to be changing, since the zoologist saw her aim at the event as pedagogical. The ambiguity of the situation is illustrated by means of analysis of a transcript of a fragment of conversation held during the interaction. This ambiguity consists in the situation revealing some characteristic features of both formal and non-formal types of interaction. The analysis of underlying organizational structures of the interaction allows suggesting that this interaction is quasi-formal because its order is not prescrip-tive-it only limits what is possible in the given situation. Also discussed are the philosophical implications of changing the theoretical frame of analysis undertaken by the author with the aim of better grasping the empirical material at hand.},

  abstract = {In the paper, I propose a project of social coordination as naturalistic social ontology (CNSO) based on the rules-in-equilibria theory of social institutions (Guala and Hindriks 2015; Hindriks and Guala 2015). It takes coordination as the main ontological unit of the social, a mechanism homological across animals and humans, for both can handle coordination problems: in the forms of “animal conventions” and social institutions, respectively. On this account, institutions are correlated equilibria with normative force. However, if both humans and animals solve coordination problems in a similar way, and only humans have social institutions, how do the latter evolve? I suggest identifying possible causes of this evolution among cognitive capacities like mindreading and imitation by building dynamic models. Social ontology becomes constrained by the evolution of the forms of coordination and by the cognitive mechanisms involved in the emergence and persistence of social institutions. It means that it becomes bound to what might be derived from social institutions, i.e., social roles, structures and their derivatives. It shows how conceptual relations might emerge from causal. I conclude the paper with the discussion of the relationship between involved types of explanation, mechanistic and equilibrium ones.},

  abstract = {Although the ideas in {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}Process and Reality{$<$}/em{$>$} are well-recognized by many scientists in various disciplines beyond philosophy, these investigations are focused on the formal interpretation of the notion of space in the context of mereotopology. Indeed, the notion of time is either neglected completely or understood as an abstraction from the four-dimensional existence of enduring objects. However, there is no elucidation of the notion of time beyond this existence. We introduce a monadic second order language to formalize the ultimate principles presupposed to Whitehead's investigation, i.e., creativity, novelty and advance have been analyzed and reformulated as axioms. The models of the formulated theory are linear process structures, which are a special type of occurrence structures. The model-theoretic aspects of their theory are discussed in the present paper. Our fundamental theorem indicates that the worlds, which ground the knowledge of actual occasions, are ordered linearly and are equal for contemporaneous actual occasions, which implies a condition essential to the being of time.}

  abstract = {A theoretical analysis is made of the evolution of behavioural strategies in contest situations. It is assumed that behaviour will evolve so as to maximize individual fitness. If so, a population will evolve an ‘evolutionarily stable strategy’, or ESS, which can be defined as a strategy such that, if all members of a population adopt it, no ‘mutant’ strategy can do better. A number of simple models of contest situations are analysed from this point of view. It is concluded that in ‘symmetric’ contests the ESS is likely to be a ‘mixed’ strategy; that is, either the population will be genetically polymorphic or individuals will be behaviourally variable. Most real contests are probably asymmetric, either in pay-off to the contestants, or in size or weapons, or in some ‘uncorrelated’ fashion; i.e. in a fashion which does not substantially bias either the pay-offs or the likely outcome of an escalated contest. An example of an uncorrelated asymmetry is that between the ‘discoverer’ of a resource and a ‘late-comer’. It is shown that the ESS in asymmetric contests will usually be to permit the asymmetric cue to settle the contest without escalation. Escalated contests will, however, occur if information to the contestants about the asymmetry is imperfect.},

\section{Okasha — Biology and the Theory of\\
Rationality}

\begin{quotation}

\par
when we explain an organism’s behavior in terms of its biological\\
rationality, for example, a chimpanzee fashioning a tool from a twig\\
in order to catch termites, this yields exactly the sort of intelligibility\\
that McDowell treats as definitive of rationalizing explanations.\\
We are able to see how the behavior makes sense, or is appropriate,\\
in terms of the organism’s goal (acquiring food), which itself subserves\\
the ultimate goal of maximizing fitness. The type of understanding that\\
we get of the organism’s behavior is more akin to the type of under-\\
standing we get from intentional explanation than from physical\\
explanation.— с 168
\par
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
One distinctive feature of the biological rationality concept is that it\\
is externalist. A behavior counts as biologically rational if it is fitness\\
maximizing or adaptive, which depends on the environment.— с 168

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Though sui generis, bio-\\
logical rationality is still a bona fide type of rationality because it\\
enables us to “make sense” of the beliefs and actions of both humans and nonhumans by showing how they help to fulfill their\\
evolutionary goal. — с. 169-170

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Ecological rationality theorists emphasize the domain-specific nature\\
of the heuristics that guide human decision making. A heuristic helps us\\
with a particular task, for example, determining whether a social\\
partner is honest. Different tasks call for different heuristics, so the\\
human mind is an “adaptive toolbox,” Gigerenzer and Selten (2001)\\
argue. — ч 170

  abstract = {The active inference framework, and in particular its recent formulation as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a useful approach for modeling neurocognitive processes. This framework is highly general and flexible in its ability to be customized to model any cognitive process, as well as simulate predicted neuronal responses based on its accompanying neural process theory. It also affords both simulation experiments for proof of principle and behavioral modeling for empirical studies. However, there are limited resources that explain how to build and run these models in practice, which limits their widespread use. Most introductions assume a technical background in programming, mathematics, and machine learning. In this paper we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to build POMDPs, run simulations using standard MATLAB routines, and fit these models to empirical data. We assume a minimal background in programming and mathematics, thoroughly explain all equations, and provide exemplar scripts that can be customized for both theoretical and empirical studies. Our goal is to provide the reader with the requisite background knowledge and practical tools to apply active inference to their own research. We also provide optional technical sections and multiple appendices, which offer the interested reader additional technical details.

"Equi l i br i um explanations, as I will call them, present a distinct set of counterexamples for the causal requirement. Or, at the very least, they suggest that more attention needs to be paid to specifying exactly what it is for an explanation to be causal. Additionally, equilibrium explanations have an interesting bearing on the role of the statistical relevance idea in the theory of explanation, in that equilibrium explanations show how the cause of an event can be (statistically) irrelevant to its explanation" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/9X6YBCJ2?page=1}{Sober 1983:201})

"Th e causal explanation focuses exclusively on the actual trajectory of the population; the equilibrium explanation situates that actual trajectory (whatever it may have been) in a more encompassing structure. It is in this way that equilibrium explanations can be more explanatory than causal explanations even though they provide less information about what the actual cause was. This difference arises from the fact that explanations provide understanding, and understanding can be enhanced without providing more details about what the cause was."

Psychological considerations are crucial both to a proper characterization of what is cultural and to a proper explanation of cultural phenomena. The chapter suggests that a properly naturalistic approach to social and cultural phenomena centrally involves identifying the causal factors and mechanisms that shape these causal chains and explaining the macroregularities and changes of social and cultural life in term of these microprocesses. It also argues that cognition enables culture through domain-specific constructive mechanisms. Cognitive processes are linked to one another in causal chains such chains are Cognitive Causal Chains (CCCs). Social Cognitive Causal Chains (SCCC) that have the function of preserving mental content, behavioral form, or both, may extend across many individual and through a social group, distributing throughout this group similar mental representations or public productions. Such representations and productions are cultural and the SCCCs that distribute them are cultural CCCs.},

  abstract = {Equilibrium explanations use an equilibrium to represent and explain a system’s dynamic behavior. They provide a system with the property of global stability: a system will converge towards and remain in equilibrium regardless of its initial conditions and dynamic process. Thus, equilibrium explanations are generally treated as non-causal explanations. There are two claims subsumed under that comprehensive thesis. The first claim is that equilibrium explanations do not identify any causes because a system with global stability resists manipulation. The second claim is that even if equilibrium explanations do identify causes by manipulation, those causes are embedded in a system’s deeper, underlying structural relationships, and those causes are irrelevant to explaining a system’s behavior. Only the system’s structural relationships are relevant. But equilibrium explanations are not monolithic. I compare dynamic systems with multiple, competing equilibria to systems with a globally stable equilibrium. Equilibrium explanations of the former use intervention on a system’s initial conditions and dynamic process to manipulate equilibria, which identifies causes. Furthermore, a system’s initial conditions and dynamic process are relevant to explaining why one equilibrium is selected instead of another. I then apply these lessons to systems with a globally stable equilibrium and discuss when their corresponding equilibrium explanations have a proper role in the parent sciences.},

In contexts that involve two or more agents who have to take account of each others' deliberation, the counterfactual reasoning may become quite complex. When I deliberate, I have to consider not only what the causal effects would be of alternative choices that I might make, but also what other agents might believe about the potential effects of my choices, and how their alternative possible actions might affect my beliefs. Counterfactual possibilities are implicit in the models that game theorists and decision theorists have developed – in the alternative branches in the trees that model extensive form games and the different cells of the matrices of strategic form representations – but much of the reasoning about those possibilities remains in the informal commentary on and motivation for the models developed. Puzzlement is sometimes expressed by game theorists about the relevance of what happens in a game ‘off the equilibrium path’: of what would happen if what is (according to the theory) both true and known by the players to be true were instead false.},

  abstract = {There is a very striking difference between even the simplest ethnographically known human societies and those of the chimps and bonobos. Chimp and bonobo societies are closed societies: with the exception of adolescent females who disperse from their natal group and join a nearby group (never to return to their group of origin), a {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}pan{$<$}/em{$>$} residential group is the whole social world of the agents who make it up. That is not true of forager bands, which have fluid memberships, and regular associations with neighbouring bands. They are components of a larger social world. The open and fluid character of forager bands brings with it many advantages, so the stability of this more vertically complex form of social life is not difficult to explain, once it establishes. But how did it establish, if, as is likely, earlier hominin social worlds resemble those of our close {$<$}em class="EmphasisTypeItalic"{$>$}pan{$<$}/em{$>$} relatives in the suspicion (even hostility) of one band to another? How did hominin social organisation transition from life in closed bands, each distrustful of its neighbours, to the much more open social lives of foragers? I will discuss and synthesise two approaches to this problem, one ecological, based on the work of Robert Layton and his colleagues, and another that is organised around an expansion of kin recognition, an idea primarily driven by Bernard Chapais. The paper closes by discussing potential archaeological signatures both of more open social worlds, and of the supposed causal drivers of such worlds.},

  abstract = {This paper contributes to a debate in the palaeoarchaeological community about the major time-lag between the origin of anatomically modern humans and the appearance of typically human cultural behaviour. Why did humans take so long—at least 100 000 years—to become ‘behaviourally modern’? The transition is often explained as a change in the intrinsic cognitive competence of modern humans: often in terms of a new capacity for symbolic thought, or the final perfection of language. These cognitive breakthrough models are not satisfactory, for they fail to explain the uneven palaeoanthropological record of human competence. Many supposed signature capacities appear (and then disappear) before the supposed cognitive breakthrough; many of the signature capacities disappear again after the breakthrough. So, instead of seeing behavioural modernity as a simple reflection of a new kind of mind, this paper presents a niche construction conceptual model of behavioural modernity. Humans became behaviourally modern when they could reliably transmit accumulated informational capital to the next generation, and transmit it with sufficient precision for innovations to be preserved and accumulated. In turn, the reliable accumulation of culture depends on the construction of learning environments, not just intrinsic cognitive machinery. I argue that the model is (i) evolutionarily plausible: the elements of the model can be assembled incrementally, without implausible selective scenarios; (ii) the model coheres with the broad palaeoarchaeological record; (iii) the model is anthropologically and ethnographically plausible; and (iv) the model is testable, though only in coarse, preliminary ways.},

"Gintis follows Robert Frank (Frank 1988 ) in taking gene-culture co-evolution to have reshaped human psychology in ways that require a shift in modelling strategies. Humans have come to live in social worlds in which fi tness depends on co-operative partnerships, and hence we have come to live in social worlds in which fi tness depends on reputation. We reap the benefi ts of co-operative partnerships only if we are of good repute, for that makes it likely that we will be chosen by others for profi table partnerships. Fitness depends on agents seeming to be good, to be trustworthy. Th e best way of seeming to be good is to be good. Our moral emotions evolved in this selective regime, to be both signals of, and motivations for, our social other-oriented dispositions."

"Models (in contrast to theories) represent their real-world target systems indirectly. 1 A model is not a partial, incomplete or idealized direct description of the world: it is a fully accurate description of an ideal or fi ctional system. Model specifi cations are not schematic or partial descriptions of realworld systems: such specifi cations do not just suppress irrelevant detail; they specify properties known not to be satisfi ed by any real-world system. So, for example, many population genetics models are models of infi nite populations within which organisms mate at random. No biological populations have such properties. Models are useful to the extent that these ideal systems are importantly similar to real-world target systems, and we can use those similarities to give us explanatory and predictive leverage over real-world systems (Godfrey-Smith 2006 Weisberg 2007 Godfrey-Smith 2009 )."

"Over the past 10,000 years, the geographic, demographic, economic and social worlds of most humans have changed in ways those ancient humans could not imagine. Informational demands have changed, as human social worlds have become larger and more stratifi ed, with human action often being routed through social institutions with specifi c routines and protocols. Th e time horizon of decision and planning has lengthened: foragers act in time horizons of hours, days, perhaps a week. Subsistence farmers invest time, labour and energy in activity that will pay off , if at all, months later. Contemporary humans invest in education and pension plans whose payoff s come decades after investment." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RWAUIPXN?page=4}{Sterelny 2012:249})

"Th e experimental games provide evidence that the rational economic agent framework does not model the intrinsic computational architecture of humans well. Hence it does not give a context-general model of human decision making.

"In my view, Ross and Binmore are largely right about information, but wrong about punishment; once co-operation is established in human groups, information does fl ow freely, because work is social. We extract, transform and often distribute resources in teams. Close ecological and economic co-operation generates information about one another as a free side eff ect (Sterelny 2007 ). Once co-operation is established as a stable feature of human social worlds, agents will often no longer routinely have to invest time and eff ort in fi nding out about one another (though in special circumstances, in high-stakes decisions, they may). However, this free access to information changes in the transition to larger and more complex societies in the late Holocene. As social worlds become larger, and as they develop more specialization and social stratifi cation, the automatic fl ow of information in the village glasshouse dwindles, and increasingly we need to rely on third-party opinion through gossip networks, and on social markers (the right accent, the right clothes). Th e cost of information goes up, and its reliability falls." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RWAUIPXN?page=10}{Sterelny 2012:255})

"Strong-reciprocator psychology is still a version of instrumental rationality. Strong reciprocators have utility functions in which objective costs and benefi ts are modulated by subjective costs and rewards, as the welfare of others counts to an agent in his or her assessment of the utility of an act.

"Behavioural ecologists have developed plausible models showing that such apparently dysfunctional behaviours in fact maximize fi tness.

"Individuals optimize. But they optimize subject to constraints imposed by the conditions under which they act and the choices of other agents (Winterhalder and Smith 2000 Laland and Brown 2002 Smith and Winterhalder 2003 Laland 2007 ). Such models of adaptive decision making have a common structure. Th ey specify the optimal behaviour, given a set of assumptions about the environment, the range of options available, and the impact of choice on fi tness. Forager women, for example, face diffi cult trade-off s over birth spacing, as their nomadic life style and the costs of mobility mean that they cannot care for a second child until the fi rst can travel unassisted (see for example Kaplan 1996 Blurton Jones et al. 2006 ). So a Kung pattern of birth spacing is the result of choice constrained by social and physical environment. !Kung women respond both to the objective resource envelope and to the choices that others make. If her social group moves, a !Kung mother must move with it (Blurton Jones 1997a 1997b )." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RWAUIPXN?page=13}{Sterelny 2012:258})

"As with rational agent models, human behavioural ecologists do not model thinking, certainly not conscious, explicit thinking. We do not consciously, deliberately, maximize fi tness. So rather than being models of individual computational architecture, they too are models of resilient behavioural dispositions. Th e core achievement of these models, when they are successful, is to identify the real options available to the agent, and the costs and benefi ts imposed by the environment on these options. So these models represent the interaction between choice, current environment and outcome. But while they do not model thinking, they have cognitive presuppositions. Th ey implicitly rely on agents having the ability to track their world. Th e explanation of Kung fertility relies on humans having cognitive mechanisms that allow them to assess the causal structure of their environment, and to recognize the likely consequences of their actions. And it presupposes that proximate motivation tracks fi tness. Humans do not consciously aim at maximizing their fi tness any more than salmon do. But the outcomes we prefer increase fi tness; those we avoid reduce fi tness. So while !Kung women do not plan to maximize the number of their surviving grandchildren, they do plan to have (say) well-fed and well-behaved children, and those goals (if achieved) covary systematically with their fi tness. Th e proximate targets of action are fi tness resources. As we shall see, population-level processes play a key role in stabilizing the connection" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RWAUIPXN?page=16}{Sterelny 2012:261})

"If we can insightfully model agents as fi tness maximizers in small worlds, why is it so much less useful for large worlds? Th at is not because small-scale worlds are precultural, that 'biology dominates culture in, but only in, such worlds'. Ethnographers have amply documented the very rich cultural life of historically known foragers and traditional agriculturalists. While there is some controversy about the richness of the symbolic and normative life of the very earliest members of our species, the physical record of rich culture is at least 40,000 plus years old (Klein and Edgar 2002 ). Moreover, natural selection continues to act in large-scale social worlds. Indeed, if Jared Diamond and others are right, the fate of large-scale social worlds has often depended on diff erential susceptibility to diff erent diseases (this idea is not new; see Zizsser 1935 Diamond 1998 Crosby 2004 ). All core human activities are profoundly infl uenced by both our inherited culture and our inherited biology." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RWAUIPXN?page=17}{Sterelny 2012:262})
\par
"Th e transition to large-scale social life reshapes the sources of cultural information. Individuals remain adaptable and responsive, but population-level mechanisms change, reshaping the extent to which individual decision making tracks fi tness. As a consequence of reshaped cultural learning, proximate motivation is less well tuned to fi tness interests. In fl uent," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RWAUIPXN?page=17}{Sterelny 2012:262})
\par
"From fi tness to utility 263 practiced decision making, we continue to make eff ective decisions to get want we want. But what we want less reliably tracks our genetic interests. Th e propensity of individuals in small-scale worlds to make near-optimal fi tness-maximizing decisions depends on their capacity to acquire the information they need and to tune their subjective goals to their objective needs. Th ese mechanisms of individual adaptation are stressed in the transition to large-scale social worlds. As human social worlds shrink in number and variety, but grow in size and vertical complexity, the mix of biological and cultural factors changes. As a consequence of that changed mix, human agents shift from being fi tness maximizers (perhaps roughly approximated as resource maximizers) to utility maximizers. For the transition to mass society makes tracking instrumental information more complex, and makes the connection between proximal motivation and fi tness more fragile. But despite the increased complexity of these new social worlds, our mechanisms of rational appraisal are intact. In a range of key cases, we continue to make instrumentally eff ective decisions. But the link between conscious goals and fi tness resources is fractured. We less reliably want what our genes need." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RWAUIPXN?page=18}{Sterelny 2012:263})
\par
"Since agents do not (typically) subjectively aim at maximizing fi tness, human behavioural ecology presupposes that there is a stable correlation between the proximate desires of agents and fi tness: what agents want are fuels for fi tness. Children inherit values as well as information from their parents. Maladaptive values are fi ltered out, just as maladaptive beliefs are. Th e transitions to mass society make these fi ltering mechanisms less eff ective: children acquire less of their information and less of their values and goals from their parents, and from close associates of their parents who are informational and ideological duplicates of their parents." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RWAUIPXN?page=19}{Sterelny 2012:264})
\par
"So a hypothesis suggests itself: with the transition to mass societies, there is a radical decline in individual-level heritability of those traits whose development is culture dependent. In traditional societies, children ideologically and informationally resemble their parents, because they inherit - to a signifi cant degree - their values and goals, and their instrumental lore. Seriously maladaptive lore and values are less likely to be rebuilt in the next generation, for the same reason seriously maladaptive genes become rarer."

"Group selection is powerful when (i) the metapopulation is large, with signifi cant and stable variation between groups; (ii) groups diff er from one another in their prospects for survival, and for founding new groups; (iii) groups that bud from parent groups resemble those parents; (iv) the groups themselves are internally homogenous (for otherwise individual selection within groups may preempt group selection). Arguably, the growing importance of culture and cultural life resulted in human metapopulations satisfying these conditions (Sober and Wilson 1998 Richerson and Boyd 2001 Richerson et al. 2003 Boyd et al. 2005 Gintis 2007 )."

"Enculturation increases the informational load on adaptive action. Compared with our minimally cultured ancestors, wielding something like Oldowan technology, and living in social worlds roughly comparable to those of chimps in size and complexity, later hominins needed a much richer stock of information. A brief and partial list of the increased requirements might include the following. (i) A much expanded folk psychology: later hominins routinely engage in joint planning and collective action, and this requires information about the capacities and intentions of social partners. (ii) Later hominins need to understand human symbolic systems, most obviously language, but depictive representation, and signals of age, status and role encoded in dress and action. (iii) A successful agent in recent hominin social worlds needs to understand the norms and normatively laden customs of that world. (iv) Our core group size has probably expanded. So we each will need an expanded database of individual agents: a database that will include partial biography and social assessment, not just recognitional capacity (Dunbar 2001 2003 ). (v) Human social worlds have become vertically complex. Human social worlds include teams, extended families, clans, hunting alliances and many other stable, functionally important units intermediate between individual agents and the social world as a whole. Eff ective action requires the capacity to recognize and work within these intermediate units. (vi) Our technology has expanded explosively, and while (especially in contemporary worlds) no one individual is a master of all the technological resources of his or her group, each agent has the capacity to use (and sometimes make or repair) many tools and their products. Compared with our distant ancestors, we are all engineers. (vii) We have long lived in a world of trade and division of labour. So we must know the economic or exchange value of many goods."

\par
"In brief: the transition to mass society need not undermine instrumental rationality; in favourable cases, we can estimate the outcomes of action. But the targets at which we aim need not contribute systematically to fi tness maximization. Hence when mechanisms of instrumental assessment are still intact, some form of a utility-maximization model is likely to capture central phenomena of mass societies. In key cases, agents give themselves their best chance of getting what they want; but what they want is no longer reliably a fi tness resource. Utility is decoupled from fi tness."

  abstract = {Hutto and Satne identify three research traditions attempting to explain the place of intentional agency in a wholly natural world: naturalistic reduction; sophisticated behaviourism, and pragmatism, and suggest that insights from all three are necessary. While agreeing with that general approach, I develop a somewhat different package, offering an outline of a vindicating genealogy of our interpretative practices. I suggest that these practices had their original foundation in the elaboration of much more complex representation-guided control structures in our lineage and the support and amplification of those control structures through external resources. Cranes (as Dennett calls them) became increasingly important in the explanation of systematically successful action. These more complex representational engines coevolved with selection to detect and respond to the control structures of others. Since much of that selection was driven by the advantages of cooperation and coordination, in part these control structures were co-opted as external signals and guarantees, in cooperation and coordination. As the time depth of cooperation and co-ordination extended, these public signals of belief and intent acquired secondary functions, as mechanisms to stabilise and structure control systems, making humans not just more transparent to one another at a time, but more predictable over time. Mindshaping, not just mindreading, became increasingly important in our lineage.},

The paper~argues against this dichotomy, and sketches ways in which a code-based system could evolve into Gricean communication. The second is to assess the merits of the Sender–Receiver Framework, originally formulated by David Lewis, and much elaborated and set into an evolutionary context by Brian Skyrms and colleagues, as a framework for thinking about the evolution of language.

In particular, it is assumed that social behavior is controlled by 2 interacting systems that follow different operating principles. The reflective system generates behavioral decisions that are based on knowledge about facts and values, whereas the impulsive system elicits behavior through associative links and motivational orientations. The proposed model describes how the 2 systems interact at various stages of processing, and how their outputs may determine behavior in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion. It extends previous models by integrating motivational components that allow more precise predictions of behavior. The implications of this reflective-impulsive model are applied to various phenomena from social psychology and beyond. Extending previous dual-process accounts, this model is not limited to specific domains of mental functioning and attempts to integrate cognitive, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms.},

However, there are several ways of how agents can succeed in this. Two modes of anticipation, namely mindreading and behavior-reading, shape the animal mindreading debate. As a matter of fact, no position has yet convincingly ruled out the other. This paper suggests a strategy of how to argue for a mentalistic interpretation as opposed to a behavioral interpretation. The first step suggests considering a pluralistic approach in order to allow for shortcomings such as not having a natural language. Second, a critical examination of the principle called Morgan’s Canon will show that this principle cannot be used as a final argument to rule out mentalistic approaches. Finally, the author argues that the setting of current experiments is responsible for the indistinguishability of mindreading versus behavior-reading and she suggests alternative experimental designs.},

"The controversy about the philosophical and social scientific significance of naturalism revitalized by the cognitive sciences, brain research in particular, is attracting increasing attention. In this context, Stephen Turner for example provocatively submits that, today, 'cognitive science ... [constitutes] ... the central challenge for social theory' (2002: 1)."

\par
"The strong/weak distinction is a meaningful criterion for staking out the field and classifying cognitive social theory. On the one extreme, Sperber's (1997) own option is for the strong version which, in his case, goes back to Chomsky and Fodor and is thus closer to orthodox cognitivism. Although taking cues from connectionism as understood by Churchland rather than orthodox cognitivism, also Turner's (2002, in this issue) proposal to conceive of social theory as cognitive neuroscience clearly falls in this category. While trying to avoid reductionism, he comes close to taking an eliminativist position which dismisses all versions of social theory based on traditional social scientific concepts such as a shared culture and practices. Luhmann's cognitive approach to system theory (1990, 1992, 1995; see Leydesdorff in this issue, Eder in this issue, and Strydom, 2006a), which since the 1980s has been inspired by cognitive biology and brain research, likewise belongs here. In these strong versions, the social dimension of cognition borne by physical or mechanical processes is the focus of attention." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SHL988N2?page=7}{Strydom 2007:345})
\par
\emph{There is a conceptual tension between strong and weak cognitivism which [[@turner2018]|Turner (2018)] tries to overcome. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SHL988N2?page=7}{note on p.345})}
\par
"On the other extreme, the approaches of the French and German rational choice sociologists, Boudon (1995, 1997; see Bouvier in this issue) and Esser (1990, 1996; see Eder in this issue) respectively, are both examples of weak cognitivism. For both, concepts like intentions, meanings, reasons and rationality are central. Pharo (1998, in this issue), who characterizes his central concern as moral sociology and his Weberian position as falling between phenomenology and cognitive science, also fits in here. While acknowledging the constraints of external reality and a certain degree of social construction of reality, he focuses specifically on subjective intentionality, reason and meaning in the form of cognitive structure" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SHL988N2?page=7}{Strydom 2007:345})
\par
"and moral orientation as the intrinsic quality of social action and social reality. By contrast with the cognitive objectivism of the strong cognitivists, then, Boudon, Esser and Pharo all represent some version or other of cognitive subjectivism." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SHL988N2?page=8}{Strydom 2007:346})
\par
"Sperber, who employs the phrase to characterise his own position, correlates infra-individualism with strong cognitivism and plays it off against weak cognitivism based on methodological individualism." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SHL988N2?page=9}{Strydom 2007:347})
\par
\emph{[[@sperber1997]|Sperber (1997)] contrasts his own position, which is infra-individualism based on strong cognitivism, to methodological individualism based on weak cognitivism. (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SHL988N2?page=9}{note on p.347})}
\par
"Methodological individualism itself comes in two versions. The first weak version regards the individual as the basic unit of social structure in opposition to holism which prioritises institutional contexts or group concepts instead. The strong version treats the individual as a conscious subject and focuses on human actions and reasons in opposition not merely to holism but especially also to infraindividualism. An exemplary instance of this second type is Boudon's (1995, 1997, 1998) cognitive rationalism." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SHL988N2?page=9}{Strydom 2007:347})
\par
"Infra-individualism, by contrast, refersto productive processes in the organism below the level of the individual and therefore strips the actor or agent of all significance for the explication of social phenomena. If one accepts that there are several sub-levels of infra-individualism, stretching from modules through neurons to genes, not to mention still more primitive levels, then it would seem as though Turner's position (in this issue) could also be classified as infra-individualist."

  abstract = {Philippe Huneman ha cuestionado recientemente los límites en la aplicación de los modelos mecanicistas de la explicación científica en base a la existencia de lo que denomina "explicaciones estructurales", en las que el fenómeno se explica en virtud de las propiedades matemáticas del sistema en que el fenómeno ocurre. Las explicaciones estructurales pueden darse en formas muy diversas: en virtud de la forma de pajarita (bowtie) de la estructura, de las propiedades topológicas del sistema, de los equilibrios alcanzados, etc. El papel que juegan las matemáticas en las explicaciones que apelan a la estructura de pajarita o a las propiedades topológicas del sistema ha sido recientemente examinado en varios trabajos. Sin embargo, el papel exacto que juegan las matemáticas en el caso de las explicaciones en términos de equilibrio aún no ha sido totalmente clarificado, y diferentes autores defienden interpretaciones contradictorias, algunas de las cuales las asemejarían más al modelo defendido por algunos filósofos mecanicistas que al modelo estructural de Huneman. En este trabajo, tratamos de cubrir ese déficit estudiando el papel que juegan las matemáticas en el modelo de equilibrio anidado (nested equilibrium) elaborado por Blaser y Kirchner para explicar la estabilidad de las asociaciones ontogenética y filogenéticamente persistentes entre humanos y microorganismos. De nuestro análisis se desprende que su modelo es explicativo porque i) se identifica una estructura matemática del sistema que viene dada por un conjunto de ecuaciones diferenciales que satisfacen una estrategia evolutivamente estable; ii) la estructura anidada del modelo hace que la estrategia evolutivamente estable sea robusta ante posibles perturbaciones; iii) esto es así porque las propiedades del sistema empírico son isomorfas a, pero no causalmente responsables de, las propiedades de la estrategia evolutivamente estable. La combinación de estas tres tesis hace que las explicaciones en términos de equilibrios se asemejen más al modelo estructural de explicación que al modelo mecanístico. Philippe Huneman has recently questioned the widespread application of mechanistic models of scientific explanation based on the existence of structural explanations, i.e. explanations that account for the phenomenon to be explained in virtue of the mathematical properties of the system where the phenomenon obtains, rather than in terms of the mechanisms that causally produce the phenomenon. Structural explanations are very diverse, including cases like explanations in terms of bowtie structures, in terms of the topological properties of the system, or in terms of equilibrium. The role of mathematics in bowtie structured systems and in topologically constrained systems has recently been examined in different papers. However, the specific role that mathematical properties play in equilibrium explanations requires further examination, as different authors defend different interpretations, some of them closer to the new-mechanistic approach than to the structural model advocated by Huneman. In this paper, we cover this gap by investigating the explanatory role that mathematics play in Blaser and Kirschner's nested equilibrium model of the stability of persistent long-term human-microbe associations. We argue that their model is explanatory because: i) it provides a mathematical structure in the form of a set of differential equations that together satisfy an ESS; ii) that the nested nature of the ESSs makes the explanation of host-microbe persistent associations robust to any perturbation; iii) that this is so because the properties of the ESS directly mirror the properties of the biological system in a non-causal way. The combination of these three theses make equilibrium explanations look more similar to structural explanations than to causal-mechanistic explanation.},

Here we first distinguish basic prospection, such as associative learning, from more complex prospection commonly observed in humans, such as episodic foresight, the ability to imagine diverse future situations and organize current actions accordingly. We review recent studies on complex prospection in various contexts, such as decision-making, planning, deliberate practice, information gathering, and social coordination. Prospection appears to play many important roles in human survival and reproduction. Foreseeing threats and opportunities before they arise, for instance, drives attempts at avoiding future harm and obtaining future benefits, and recognizing the future utility of a solution turns it into an innovation, motivating refinement and dissemination. Although we do not know about the original contexts in which complex prospection evolved, it is increasingly clear through research on the emergence of these capacities in childhood and on related disorders in various clinical conditions, that limitations in prospection can have profound functional consequences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Each player works with a private description of the game, in which strategies are identified by labels; labels are generated by a stochastic labelling procedure. Each player chooses a decision rule which, for each possible private description, picks one of the available strategy labels. A criterion of collective rationality is applied to choices among decision rules. The implications of collective rationality are explored for a range of games with different labelling procedures.}

"A point of convergence for expectations is a focal point." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=2}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:610})
\par
"When he explains why moving away from zerosum games requires fundamental changes in theoretical strategy, he emphasises the "perceptual and suggestive element in the formation of mutually consistent expectations" that has no role in zero-sum games, but is the essence of focal points (pp. 83-84)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=2}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:610})
\par
"An attentive reader comes away from Strategy of ConXict with the ability to recognise focal points in a range of coordination problems that extends far beyond the speciWc examples in the book, and with an intuitive sense of the general principles that distinguish them." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=3}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:611})
\par
"One family of metaphors implies that, despite the absence of communication between the players, it is as if their minds make some kind of connection: we read about "making contact with the other player" (p. 96), the "meeting of minds" (pp. 83, 96, 106, 163, 298), the "spark of recognition" that "jumps" between the players (p. 163). Another family of metaphors, used over and over again, implies that it is as if the players are engaged together in solving a "riddle" (p. 295), jointly searching for what is variously called a "clue" (pp. 57-58, 64, 93, 96, 100, 283, 296, 299-300), "key" (p. 57), "hint" (pp. 163, 295, 297), "message" (pp. 54, 163), "signal" (pp. 66, 79-80, 100, 300, 303) or "suggestion" (pp. 54, 64, 68, 283) that is hidden in their decision problem. A third family of metaphors suggests that a focal point somehow imposes itself on the attention of the players or demands to be chosen: it is "prominent" (pp. 57-58," (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=3}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:611})
\par
"Our aim is to suggest how this riddle might be solved. We reconstruct Schelling's analysis of focal points, emphasising three surprising features. First, what might seem to be a circularity: in explaining how coordination problems are solved, Schelling assumes that players reason from the premise that these problems can be solved, the evidence for which is people's success in solving them. Second, the process of reasoning by which players Wnd focal points is not required to satisfy any principles of truth or validity, or to be capable of any kind of formal representation. Third, Schelling claims that players who reason in these apparently questionable ways are doing so with full rationality. These features are so foreign to the traditions of game theory that Schelling's readers have been unable to recognise his account as theory. The key to the riddle is to understand that the philosophical framework which supports Schelling's theory is not a deductive system but a pragmatic one." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=4}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:612})
\par
"Schelling's explanation of coordination is a reconstruction of the reasoning which, he argues, players use in Wnding focal points. This reasoning starts from the premise that, as a matter of empirical fact, people are capable of solving coordination problems." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=5}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:613})
\par
"Most situations - perhaps every situation for people who are practiced at this kind of game - provides some clue for coordinating behavior, some focal point for each person's expectation of what the other expects him to expect to be expected to do. (p. 57)" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=5}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:613})
\par
"Schelling insists that his players do not use the individualistic form of best-response reasoning represented in conventional game theory. That is, the rational husband does not Wrst predict what the rational wife will do, and then choose a best response to that. Nor does the husband go one level deeper, predicting what the wife would choose as a best response to her prediction about what the husband will do. Nor does he go to deeper levels of reasoning still. When Schelling notes that such reasoning can go on ad inWnitum, he is implicitly recognising that, under the assumption of common knowledge of rationality, best-response reasoning about coordination games leads to an inWnite regress." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=6}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:614})
\par
"It seems that, on Schelling's account, the players are reasoning together. A player who uses best-response reasoning decomposes his problem into two components - predicting what the other player will do, and choosing what to do himself. The prediction is logically prior to the decision about what to do. When it comes to deciding what to do, it no longer matters why the other player will behave according to the prediction: that behaviour is taken as given. In Keynes's analysis, and more generally in models of cognitive hierarchy, best-reply reasoning is possible because each player assumes himself to be cleverer than the other. In Schelling's analysis, in contrast, the players are conscious of their both reasoning on the same principles towards a common conclusion." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=7}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:615})
\par
"A number of theorists have tried to assimilate focal points to game theory in a way which represents the players as reasoning together. The approach we now describe was Wrst proposed by Gauthier (1975). Later versions have been proposed by Bacharach (1993); Sugden (1995); Janssen (2001) and Casajus (2001). The underlying idea of team reasoning in games can be traced back to Hodgson (1967). These theorists propose models in which players solve problems of equilibrium selection by choosing the equilibrium (if there is one) which is uniquely best for both of them. Some theorists treat this principle of equilibrium selection (often called payoV dominance) as a primitive. Others treat it as an implication of a distinctive mode of rational choice (team reasoning or we-reasoning) in which individuals "identify" with a group (in this case, the group comprising the two players) and Wnd the combination of actions which maximises that group's shared objective; each individual then chooses her part of this combination." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=7}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:615})
\par
"the focal point depends on who the parties are and what they know about one another." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=7}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:615})
\par
"Schelling's experimental evidence shows that the focal point is "heads" (pp. 55-56).4 It is hard to see how any plausible re-description of this problem in terms of respondents' own conceptual schemes can eliminate the formal symmetry between "heads" and "tails". Schelling's explanation is that "heads" has "some kind of conventional priority" over "tails", but if we re-describe the game as a choice between "the thing that has higher priority" and "the thing that has lower priority" we do not change the formal structure of the coordination problem. Schelling can say that "heads" is focal by virtue of an obvious association of ideas between "priority" and "choosing", but the theory of team reasoning is about optimisation, not associations of ideas." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=8}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:616})
\par
"One of the biggest diYculties facing anyone trying to represent this kind of reasoning in a formal model is the unstructured and unbounded set of possible coordination devices. Thus, in the example of separated spouses, Schelling allows the search for clues to range over analogy, precedent, aesthetics, geometry, casuistic reasoning, whimsy, and the "logic" of joint optimality. Any one of these sources of clues could constitute a theory in itself. Indeed, the theory of primary and secondary salience can be thought of as a model in which the only clues come from non-rational psychological inclinations. Similarly, the theory of team reasoning can be thought of as a model in which the only clues come from joint optimality." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=8}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:616})
\par
"Strategy of ConXict shows that real players, individually and collectively, can beneWt by making use of the suggestive power of certain features of games." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=10}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:618})
\par
"a theory of practical rationality should take focal points analogous with "heads". Thus, Wnd them." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=10}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:618})
\par
"we suggest, Schelling means something deeper than this. His understanding of rationality itself is empirical in the following sense: a principle of decision is rational for an agent just to the extent that, by using it, the agent tends to be successful in achieving her ends." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=11}{Sugden and Zamarrón 2006:619})
\par
\emph{Is there connection to "fitness maximization" and [[@mouden2012]], [[@okasha2015]] and [[@hammerstein2016]] (ch. 16)? (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/DR98LCES?page=11}{note on p.619})}
\par
"It is important to understand that the conception of rationality that we are attributing to Schelling is not the instrumental rationality on which conventional game theory is grounded. The latter conception takes an agent's preferences and beliefs as given and then, using formal axioms which can be interpreted as representing principles of valid practical reasoning, deduces which of a set of feasible actions best satisWes those preferences relative to those beliefs. In this perspective, coordination games are problematic because this kind of deductive reasoning fails to identify a unique solution. In contrast, Schelling imposes no restrictions of validity on players' reasoning: we infer that a mode of reasoning is rational by induction from its success."

  abstract = {Exploration of a new integrative intellectual enterprise: the cognitive social sciences.Research in the cognitive sciences has advanced significantly in recent decades. Computational cognitive modeling has profoundly changed the ways in which we understand cognition. Empirical research has progressed as well, offering new insights into many psychological phenomena. This book investigates the possibility of exploiting the successes of the cognitive sciences to establish a better foundation for the social sciences, including the disciplines of sociology, anthropology, economics, and political science. The result may be a new, powerful, integrative intellectual enterprise: the cognitive social sciences.The book treats a range of topics selected to capture issues that arise across the social sciences, covering computational, empirical, and theoretical approaches. The chapters, by leading scholars in both the cognitive and the social sciences, explore the relationship between cognition and society, including such issues as methodologies of studying cultural differences; the psychological basis of politics (for instance, the role of emotion and the psychology of moral choices); cognitive dimensions of religion; cognitive approaches to economics; meta-theoretical questions on the possibility of the unification of social and cognitive sciences. Combining depth and breadth, the book encourages fruitful interdisciplinary interaction across many fields.},

The theory assumes that knowledge can be divided into biologically primary knowledge that we have evolved to acquire and biologically secondary knowledge that is important for cultural reasons. Secondary knowledge, unlike primary knowledge, is the subject of instruction. It is processed in a manner that is analogous to the manner in which biological evolution processes information. When dealing with secondary knowledge, human cognition requires a very large information store, the contents of which are acquired largely by obtaining information from other information stores. Novel information is generated by a random generate and test procedure with only very limited amounts of novel information able to be processed at any given time. In contrast, very large amounts of organized information stored in the information store can be processed in order to generate complex action. This architecture has been used to generate instructional procedures, summarized in this chapter.},

  abstract = {Two major questions have dominated work on the metaphysics of social groups: first, Are there any? And second, What are they? I will begin by arguing that the answer to the ontological question is an easy and obvious 'yes'. We do better to turn our efforts elsewhere, addressing the question: "What are social groups?" One might worry, however, about this question on grounds that the general term 'social group' seems like a term of art—not a well-used concept we can analyze, or can presuppose corresponds to a real kind we can investigate. But while the general notion of 'social group' may be a term of art, our terms for clubs and courts, races and genders, are not. It is worth stepping back to ask what function these social group concepts serve. I will argue that individual social group concepts function to give normative structure to our lives together. Paying attention to the role of norms in social groups, I will argue, can enable us to provide a unified understanding of the importance of core social groups, while still respecting the great differences among social groups of different kinds.}

At the heart of this idea is a different take on social metaphysics from most standard current accounts in that it begins with empirical, phylogenetic capacities of human beings for social practices (realizing abstract thought in the world) as well as relationality (the need for attachments to others). The combination of these two essential human capacities, what I call the practical-relational nexus, is generative of more complex social reality. The ontogeny of any social reality is the result of the ways that this practical-relational nexus has been organized and shaped by external social structures and systems, themselves the product of certain kinds of social power. I then explore the metaphysics of social power before considering the ways that this approach to social metaphysics can inform practical reasoning with the capacity for social and political criticism.},

  abstract = {Humans’ interactions with each other or with socially competent machines exhibit lawful coordination patterns at multiple levels of description. According to Coordination Dynamics, such laws specify the flow of coordination states produced by functional synergies of elements (e.g., cells, body parts, brain areas, people…) that are temporarily organized as single, coherent units. These coordinative structures or synergies may be mathematically characterized as informationally coupled self-organizing dynamical systems (Coordination Dynamics). In this paper, we start from a simple foundation, an elemental model system for social interactions, whose behavior has been captured in the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. We follow a tried and tested scientific method that tightly interweaves experimental neurobehavioral studies and mathematical models. We use this method to further develop a body of empirical research that advances the theory toward more generalized forms. In concordance with this interdisciplinary spirit, the present paper is written both as an overview of relevant advances and as an introduction to its mathematical underpinnings. We demonstrate HKB’s evolution in the context of social coordination along several directions, with its applicability growing to increasingly complex scenarios. In particular, we show that accommodating for symmetry breaking in intrinsic dynamics and coupling, multiscale generalization and adaptation are principal evolutions. We conclude that a general framework for social coordination dynamics is on the horizon, in which models support experiments with hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights. © Copyright © 2020 Tognoli, Zhang, Fuchs, Beetle and Kelso.},

  abstract = {A leading expert on evolution and communication presents an empirically based theory of the evolutionary origins of human communication that challenges the dominant Chomskian view.Human communication is grounded in fundamentally cooperative, even shared, intentions. In this original and provocative account of the evolutionary origins of human communication, Michael Tomasello connects the fundamentally cooperative structure of human communication (initially discovered by Paul Grice) to the especially cooperative structure of human (as opposed to other primate) social interaction. Tomasello argues that human cooperative communication rests on a psychological infrastructure of shared intentionality (joint attention, common ground), evolved originally for collaboration and culture more generally. The basic motives of the infrastructure are helping and sharing: humans communicate to request help, inform others of things helpfully, and share attitudes as a way of bonding within the cultural group. These cooperative motives each created different functional pressures for conventionalizing grammatical constructions. Requesting help in the immediate you-and-me and here-and-now, for example, required very little grammar, but informing and sharing required increasingly complex grammatical devices. Drawing on empirical research into gestural and vocal communication by great apes and human infants (much of it conducted by his own research team), Tomasello argues further that humans' cooperative communication emerged first in the natural gestures of pointing and pantomiming. Conventional communication, first gestural and then vocal, evolved only after humans already possessed these natural gestures and their shared intentionality infrastructure along with skills of cultural learning for creating and passing along jointly understood communicative conventions. Challenging the Chomskian view that linguistic knowledge is innate, Tomasello proposes instead that the most fundamental aspects of uniquely human communication are biological adaptations for cooperative social interaction in general and that the purely linguistic dimensions of human communication are cultural conventions and constructions created by and passed along within particular cultural groups.},

  abstract = {Tool-making or culture, language or religious belief: ever since Darwin, thinkers have struggled to identify what fundamentally differentiates human beings from other animals. Michael Tomasello weaves his twenty years of comparative studies of humans and great apes into a compelling argument that cooperative social interaction is the key to our cognitive uniqueness. Tomasello maintains that our prehuman ancestors, like today's great apes, were social beings who could solve problems by thinking. But they were almost entirely competitive, aiming only at their individual goals. As ecological changes forced them into more cooperative living arrangements, early humans had to coordinate their actions and communicate their thoughts with collaborative partners. Tomasello's "shared intentionality hypothesis" captures how these more socially complex forms of life led to more conceptually complex forms of thinking. In order to survive, humans had to learn to see the world from multiple social perspectives, to draw socially recursive inferences, and to monitor their own thinking via the normative standards of the group. Even language and culture arose from the preexisting need to work together and coordinate thoughts. A Natural History of Human Thinking is the most detailed scientific analysis to date of the connection between human sociality and cognition.},

However, the method has yet to fully find its place within critical realism, generally regarded as reductionist and methodological individualist and thus inadequate to the task of grasping the full and enigmatic complexity of social life. This article contributes to the discussion by suggesting an alternative approach to computer simulations in the social realm. Instead of representing reality, simulations are seen as a way of boosting abstraction by enabling us to isolate and study the effects of emergent mechanisms. The need for such tools is growing more urgent in an age characterized by rapid change and global networks of causal interrelation. Hence there is a need not only for new tools to deal with causal complexity within critical realism, but also for a critical realist perspective to fill the meta‐theoretical vacuum on which the simulation approach is largely based. The approach developed here provides a challenge to the predominant ways in which simulations are utilized today, with increasingly sophisticated models aiming towards realistic representation on the basis of empirical data.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

The present study addressed the question of whether this efficiency scales up to dyads working together to achieve a shared goal: Do people act efficiently as a group (i.e., coefficiently), or do they minimize their own or their partner’s individual costs even if this increases the overall cost for the group? We devised a novel, touch-screen-based, sequential object-transfer task to measure how people choose between different paths to coordinate with a partner. Across multiple experiments, we found that participants did not simply minimize their own or their partner’s movement costs but made coefficient decisions about paths, which ensured that the aggregate costs of movement for the dyad were minimized. These results suggest that people are able and motivated to make coefficient, collectively rational decisions when acting together.},

Because the faces were presented only briefly (30-ms), the bias is thought to reflect the early engagement of attention. The attentional bias was eliminated, however, when the faces displayed averted eye-gaze (Study 2). That is, when the threat communicated by the Black faces was attenuated by a relevant, competing socio-emotional cue—in this case, averted eye-gaze—they no longer captured perceivers’ attention. Broader implications for social cognition, as well as public policies that reify these prevailing perceptions of young Black men are discussed.},

  abstract = {Social ontology, in its broadest sense, is the study of the nature of social reality, including collective intentions and agency. The starting point of Tuomela's account of collective intentionality is the distinction between thinking and acting as a private person ("I-mode") versus as a "we-thinking" group member ("we-mode"). The we-mode approach is based on social groups consisting of persons, which may range from simple task groups consisting of a few persons to corporations and even to political states. Tuomela extends the we-mode notion to cover groups controlled by external authority. Thus, for instance, cooperation and attitude formation are studied in cases where the participants are governed "from above" as in many corporations. The volume goes on to present a systematic philosophical theory related to the collectivism-versus-individualism debate in the social sciences. A weak version of collectivism (the "we-mode" approach) depends on group-based collective intentionality. We-mode collective intentionality is not individualistically reducible and is needed to complement individualistic accounts in social scientific theorizing. The we-mode approach is used in the book to account for collective intention and action, cooperation, group attitudes, and social practices and institutions, as well as group solidarity. Tuomela establishes the first complete theory of group reasons (in the sense of members' reasons for participation in group activities). The book argues in terms of game-theoretical group-reasoning that the kind of weak collectivism that the we-mode approach involves is both conceptually and rational-functionally different from what an individualistic approach ("pro-group I-mode" approach) entails.},

Turner focuses especially on connectionism, which views learning as a process of adaptation to input that, in turn, leads to patterns of response distinct to each individual. This means that there is no common "server" from which people download shared frameworks that enable them to cooperate or communicate. Therefore, argues Turner, "practices"—in the sense that the term is widely used in the social sciences and humanities—is a myth, and so are the "cultures" that are central to anthropological and sociological thought.  In a series of tightly argued essays, Turner traces out the implications that discarding the notion of shared frameworks has for relativism, social constructionism, normativity, and a number of other concepts. He suggests ways in which these ideas might be reformulated more productively, in part through extended critiques of the work of scholars such as Ian Hacking, Andrew Pickering, Pierre Bourdieu, Quentin Skinner, Robert Brandom, Clifford Geertz, and Edward Shils.},

  abstract = {In the nineteenth century, there was substantial and sophisticated interest in neuroscience on the part of social theorists, including Comte and Spencer, and later Simon Patten and Charles Ellwood. This body of thinking faced a dead end: it could do little more than identify highly general mechanisms, and could not provide accounts of such questions as `why was there no proletarian revolution?' Psychologically dubious explanations, relying on neo-Kantian views of the mind, replaced them. With the rise of neuroscience, however, some of the problems of concern to earlier thinkers, such as imitation, have revived because of the discovery of neuronal mechanisms, or through fMRI studies. The article reviews the history and discusses the implications of current work for the reconsideration of traditional social theory concepts. It is suggested that certain kinds of bridging work with neuroscience would enable us to answer many questions in social theory that empirical sociology has failed to answer.},

"Mill's psychology, by which he meant associationism, was the fundamental discipline of the social sciences and the source of the causal force for law-like significance of generalizations in the special sciences." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PACWE5ZR?page=4}{Turner 2007:360})
\par
"Spencer's thought was a development of the combination of associationism and localization, motivated by a general evolutionary point of view, rather than specific attention to the brain or biology. For Spencer, psychology was another place in which the principles he had worked out as part of his larger evolutionary project could be made to apply. The idea of the mind as adapting to the environment, and the idea that the relationship between mind and brain was one that could be understood in terms of the physically differentiated locations in the brain, were novel, and indeed radical. Ironically, they derived from precisely the same source as the ideas of his sociology that were later to become deeply unfashionable: the idea of structural differentiation, and therefore localization, resulting from functional differentiation."

"'Who reads Spencer now?', Parsons once mockingly quoted. The answer is ironic. Spencer appears now as an honored precursor to evolutionary psychology. His influential contribution to social theory was his argument that most fundamental intellectual dispositions, including what in ethics had been understood theoretically in terms of intuitions given to the moral faculty under theory of mind, were in fact the product of evolution and under the continued effect of evolutionary processes, perhaps even including selection. A related argument was made by Baldwin, an American developmental psychologist whose work was responded to by Cooley and Mead, which is now called the 'Baldwin effect', the idea that learned characteristics could be selected for and thus become second nature to people, in parallel to, and then influencing, inheritance."

"Like Gabriel Tarde, Baldwin focused on imitation as a central means of learning, and reasoned that the variation produced by the inevitable imperfections in imitation allowed for a kind of selection (1894, 1896). A social environment composed of models of behavior of a particular kind determined what there was to imitate, as well as providing responses that selected, by producing failure or success, particular behaviors learned in this way. The general idea was that even very deep motivations varied socially because they were selected for in a specific local social environment which could have pronounced consequences."

"For Patten, the evolutionary forces produced by the pressures of adaptation to specific environmental circumstances parallel and work in terms of similar mechanisms in the mind to select for and strengthen neuronal links as well as to pare the less adaptationally valuable ones. The 'mental mechanism', as he calls it, is purification of these links, through repetition of the 'nervous arc' of neuronal connections. The effect of this strengthening, in the mind, is understood in terms of Locke and Hume on vividness of ideas. 'Purification' of this unconscious, neuron-level kind, produces clear and forceful ideas. Customs and institutions, he argues, are produced in the same way, through evolution, and become part of the subjective environment that shapes the mind. The environment of 'the sensory center', he argues: is made up of two partsthe objective environment presented through the original impressions, and the subjective environment created through the activity of related [neuronal] centers. Each impression from the outer world has added to it certain ideas from the subjective environment and the joint product is projected by the mind and seems a part of the objective world. Customs, habits, institutions and ideals are as objective and real to individuals as any part of the outer world. (Patten, 1896: 53) Here the experienced objectivity of the social world and its obligations and practices is accounted for without any sort of problematic collective psychology or claim about the objective social mind, as in Durkheim."

"Ellwood was open to Darwinian insights, but was not, as some later sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists were, reductivist. But he was not caught up in any sort of defense of a Durkheim-like notion of the causal autonomy of the social realm, nor did he take the view that 'the social' constituted some sort of natural entity which could be examined apart from psychological mechanisms that figured in social processes. On the contrary, for Ellwood there was nothing to society that was not there through the ongoing social and psychological processes of human interaction, or 'interlearning' (1925: 453-79).3" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PACWE5ZR?page=7}{Turner 2007:363})
\par
"For Ellwood, society is a metaphorical notion (1925: 460). The real causal processes involved in the production of culture, tradition, and so forth, are processes of interlearning, processes in which we are formed psychologically by the contents and results of our interactions with other people as well as with the physical world. We are driven in particular directions by evolved mental presuppositions and dispositions of various kinds, which may include dispositions to learn particular lessons and to learn about particular kinds of things."

"The idea that social theory ought to be physically and computationally realistic and cognitively realistic seems to be a very modest and unproblematic constraint.

"I have used the term "Verstehen bubble" without defining it, and there is a reason for this: the term is best understood in the narrow sense that Weber had in mindthe realm of the meaningful or intelligible, to which he added, for sociology, the qualifier of social, or oriented to other people. This is a definition within the Verstehen bubble: it uses more or less ordinary language of the sort we use in normal human communication. But we can reformulate this qualifier in cognitive science terms by reference to the concept of joint attention: something is in the Verstehen bubble if it is the object of joint attention, and potentially in the bubble if it is a potential object of joint attention. Joint attention can be defined as it is for monkeysit involves the mirror neurons or the equivalent human system. But it is also accessible to consciousness: to be jointly attentive is to be conscious of the attention of the other." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FF9422DJ?page=220}{Turner 2018:220})

It is nevertheless very real in the sense of W. I. Thomas, that a "definition of the situation is real if it is real in its consequences" (see Thomas and Thomas 1929: 572).

  abstract = {Real-world agents, humans as well as animals, observe each other during interactions and choose their own actions taking the partners' ongoing behaviour into account. Yet, classical game theory assumes that players act either strictly sequentially or strictly simultaneously without knowing each other's current choices. To account for action visibility and provide a more realistic model of interactions under time constraints, we introduce a new game-theoretic setting called transparent games, where each player has a certain probability of observing the partner's choice before deciding on its own action. By means of evolutionary simulations, we demonstrate that even a small probability of seeing the partner's choice before one's own decision substantially changes the evolutionary successful strategies. Action visibility enhances cooperation in an iterated coordination game, but reduces cooperation in a more competitive iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. In both games, "Win–stay, lose–shift" and "Tit-for-tat" strategies are predominant for moderate transparency, while a "Leader-Follower" strategy emerges for high transparency. Our results have implications for studies of human and animal social behaviour, especially for the analysis of dyadic and group interactions. Humans and animals constantly make social decisions. Should an animal during group foraging or a human at the buffet try to obtain an attractive food item but risk a confrontation with a dominant conspecific, or is it better to opt for a less attractive but non-confrontational choice, especially when considering that the situation will repeat in the future? To model decision-making in such situations game theory is widely used. However, classic game theory assumes that agents act either at the same time, without knowing each other's choices, or one after another. In contrast, humans and animals usually try to take the behaviour of their opponents and partners into account, to instantaneously adjust their own actions if possible. To provide a more realistic model of decision making in a social setting, we here introduce the concept of transparent games. It integrates the probability of observing the partner's instantaneous actions into the game-theoretic framework of knowing previous choice outcomes. We find that such "transparency" has a direct influence on the emergence of cooperative behaviours in classic iterated games. The transparent games can contribute to a deeper understanding of social behaviour and decision-making of humans and animals.},

«me. To explain how a particular convention might come into force, Lewis introduced the notion of salience. A coordination equilibrium of a game is salient if it is somehow conspicuous to all of the players, so that each player will expect all of his opponents to choose their ends of this particular equilibrium, with the result that the players actually play this equilibrium. A variety of factors, including environmental clues, can contribute to determini» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 66)

«A convention is defined as a function from a space of "states of the world", which formalizes salience, to strategy combinations of a noncooperative game which meet the PIC, so that the system is at equilibrium.» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 67)

«or Lewis, a coordination equilibrium is a convention only if the players have common knowledge of a mutual expectations criterion: MEC Each agent has a decisive reason to conform to her part of the convention given that she expects the other agents con?» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 69)

«In Aumann's model, the players are engaged in a game T = (N, S, u), and each player has a personal information partition Htk of a probability space ft. The elementary events co E ii are called the states of the world, and at each , every player k knows that the element Hkj E \%Ck such that co E Hkj has occurred, but does not in general know which {$<$}o has occurred. Intuitively, HkJ represents fc's private information regarding the states of the world. In general, while k does know the partitions of his opponents, k does not necessarily know the private information each of his opponents has regarding the states of the world. A function f:il-\^S defines a system of exogenously correlated strategy n-tuples, that is, for each {$<$}o E il, the players select a strategy combination f((o) ? (fi(co),.. . ,/?(o{$>$})) E S correlated with the state of the world co. Infor? mally, /is a correlated equilibrium if at each state of the world {$<$}o E ft, each player k follows a principle of Bayesian rationality by following /,» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 75)
\par
«that is, by playing fk((o), k maximizes his expected payoff given his private information and expectations regarding his opponents. In the following definition and in the sequel, '?' denotes expectation, pk(-) denotes player fc's subjective probability distribution and the subscript '-fc' indicates the result of removing the kth component of an n-tuple or an n-fold Cartesian pr» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 76)
\par
«The measurability restriction on fk formalizes the intuition that at each state of the world, player k knows which action he will perform. Certain common knowledge assumptions are implicit in this definition. First, the payoff structure of the game, the partitions of ft and the function /: ft -? S all must be common knowledge in order for the players to be able to compute one another's expected payoffs and thereby know that they are at correlated equilibrium. If additionally the players have common knowledge that they all follow the Bayesian rationality principle, then each player will have reason to follow her end of / and to expect the others to do the same, since they jointly maximize expected utility by foll» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 76)
\par
«In the following definition of convention, the agents refer to a com? mon information partition of the states of the world. While each agent k has a private information partition 3 k of ft, there is a partition of ft, namely the intersection Jif= Dk\^NS\^k, of the states of the world such that for each coEil, all of the agents will know which cell H(cd) E X occurs.18 The agents' expected utilities in Definition 3 are conditional on their common partition 5if, reflecting the intuition that conventions rely upon information that is public to all.» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 77)
\par
«In words, if any player; deviates unilaterally from the convention/, then every player kEN, including /, is worse off. Note that if / is a convention, then/is clearly a strict correlated equilibrium. Moreover, this definition of convention satisfies the PIC. Since the agents in a convention refer to a common partition, at each co E ft, a given player \&'s opponents all know exactly which strategy k will play, and k will want his opponents to know this. If any of fc's opponents mistakenly believed that k would play a strategy gk(co) + fk(a{$>$}) at some coEd, then this opponent might be tempted to deviate from the convention, which would leave k strictly worse off. On the other hand, if fc's opponent's all know that k will play fk((o) at every coECl, then they will all have a decisive reason to conform with f({$<$}o), with the result that k is strictly better off.» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 77)
\par
«actions. In other words, a convention / as defined in Definition 3 is salient to the players because they correlate (via/) their actions and expectations with various pieces of information at their disposal, which are formalized as elements of a partition of an event space» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 78)
\par
«xtending Lewis' definition of conventions to include correlated equi? libria also greatly expands the class of equilibria which characterize conventions. Suppose that a game T has the pure strategy coordination equilibria Ai,. .., Am, m \^ 2, and that ft is a lottery with m mutually exclusive outcomes Hl9..., Hm, such that pk(Hj = A7) for each player j. Then if the players all condition on the partition ffl = \{Hi,. . . , Hm\}, and if/: ft-?5 is defined by f(co) = A7 if coEH\vphantom\{\}, then (2.2) is satisfied for every Eil, so / is a convention. Since there are infinitely many possible values for the Ay's, any noncooperative game which has at least two pure strategy coordination equilibria has infinitely many correlated equilibria corresponding to conventions.» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 79)
\par
«In particular, the definition of convention as correlated equilibrium accounts for certain conventions which are "fair" to both players, even though the corresponding game has no "fair" coordination equilibrium in pure strategies. Neither of the pure strategy Nash equilibria in Battle of the Sexes is "fair", in the sense that the players receive the same payoff. This game has a mixed Nash equilibrium at which Player 1 plays Al with probability 3 and Player 2 plays A2 with probability 3, and at this equilibrium each player's expected payoff is 3, so this equilib? rium is "fair". However, at the mixed Nash equilibrium, both players are indifferent to the strategies they play given what each player be? lieves about her opponent, so this equilibrium fails the PIC and is consequently not a convention. Nevertheless, there is a correlated equil? ibrium fair to both players, and which each player will prefer over the pure strategy equilibrium that is unfair to her» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 79)
\par
«In the definition of convention, the players refer to a common infor? mation partition \$f. This restriction is necessary to make the definition of convention conform with the spirit of Lewis'» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 80)
\par
«ion given above, simply shifts the question up a level of abstraction. Where does salience come from? Lewis argues that a variety of factors, including pre-game communication, precedent, and environmental clues, can account for agents correlating their expec? tations on a particular coordination equilibrium. Agents can tie their actions to various "states of the world", thereby achieving correlated equilibrium.» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 81)
\par
«nals. If one accepts Quine's and Crawford and Haller's independent arguments, then to avoid infinite regress, one must either reject a conventionalist account of language, or admit that some conven? tions arise without communication. A similar regress problem confronts explanations of salience in terms of precedent. How did the precedent come about in the firs» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 82)
\par
«There is another way to explain salience, which relies primarily on the assumption that agents are Bayesian rational. Deciding which coor? dination equilibrium of many is salient is an instance of the general problem of equilibrium selection in game theory. One way to address the equilibrium selection problem is to exploit the common knowledge assumptions implicit in the correlated equilibrium concept, and to model the players as inductive deliberators (Skyrms 1991, Vanderschraaf and Skyrms 1993) who modify their beliefs about each other recursively. Given these common knowledge assumptions, if the players update their beliefs with a common inductive rule, then even if their beliefs are not initially such that they will play an equilibrium, the sequence of updated beliefs can eventually converge to an equilibrium. The dynamical process of inductive deliberation enables players to reach correlated equilibrium without com» (Vanderschraaf, 1995, p. 82)},

I introduce a solution concept for noncooperative games called anendogenous correlated equilibrium, which generalizes the Nash equilibrium concept by dropping probabilistic independence. I contrast the endogenous correlated equilibrium with the correlated equilibrium defined by Aumann (1974, 1987). I conclude that in general the endogenous correlated equilibrium concept is a more appropriate solution concept for noncooperative game theory than the less general Nash equilibrium concept. I close by discussing the relationship between endogenous correlated equilibrium and the game solution concept calledrationalizability introduced by Bernheim (1984) and Pearce (1984).}

  abstract = {There are two general classes of social conventions: conventions of coordination, and conventions of partial conflict. In coordination problems, the interests of the agents coincide, while in partial conflict problems, some agents stand to gain only if other agents unilaterally make certain sacrifices. Lewis' (1969) pathbreaking analysis of convention in terms of game theory focuses on coordination problems, and cannot accommodate partial conflict problems. In this paper, I propose a new game-theoretic definition of convention which generalizes previous game-theoretic definitions (Lewis 1969, Vanderschraaf 1995), and which can be used to characterize norms of justice in partial conflict situations. I argue that the key structural property necessary for a social arrangement to be a convention is that it be conditionally self-enforcing, in the sense that: (i) each agent has a decisive reason to follow her end of the arrangement given that she expects all to do likewise, (ii) given a different set of expectations, some agents would have had a decisive reason to deviate, and (iii) these facts are common knowledge. This leads to a definition of convention as a strict correlated equilibrium (Aumann 1974) together with appropriate common knowledge conditions. Examples are given in which it is shown how this more general account of convention can be used to analyze norms of justice as well as coordination problems.},

  abstract = {Hume is rightly credited with giving a brilliant, and perhaps the best, account of justice as               convention               . Hume's importance as a forerunner of modern economics has also long been recognized. However, most of Hume's readers have not fully appreciated how closely Hume's analysis of convention foreshadows a particular branch of economic theory, namely,               game theory               . Starting with the work of Barry (1965), Runciman and Sen (1965) and Lewis (1969), there has been a flowering of literature on the informal game-theoretic insights to be found in classics of political philosophy such as Hobbes (1651), Locke (1690), Hume (1740) and Rousseau (1755). A number of authors in this tradition, including Lewis (1969), Gauthier (1979), Mackie (1980), and Postema (1995), have identified passages in Hume which they interpret as giving informal examples of specific games. Yet, unlike his predecessors, Hobbes and Locke, Hume does much more than present examples which have a game-theoretic structure. In his account of convention, Hume gives general conditions which characterize the               resolution               of social interaction problems, and in the examples he uses to illustrate this account, Hume outlines several different methods by which agents can arrive at such a resolution. Hume's general account of convention and his explanations of the origins of particular conventions together constitute a theory of strategic interaction, which is precisely what game theory aspires to be.},

We discuss existing evidence in support of the architecture as well as open questions that remain to be empirically addressed. In addition, we suggest possible interfaces between the minimal architecture and other approaches to joint action. The minimal architecture has implications for theorising about the emergence of joint action, for human–machine interaction, and for understanding how coordination can be facilitated by exploiting relations between multiple agents’ actions and between actions and the environment.},

This would seem a trivial statement, but I believe that taking it seriously is more complicated than it appears to be, as I argue in this article. Elsewhere, I proposed the notion of “bounded functionality” As a way to describe the constraints that should be considered when trying to understand the evolution of the brain. There are two bounded-functionality constraints that are essential to any evolution-minded approach to cognitive neuroscience. The first constraint, the bricoleur constraint, describes the evolutionary pressure for any adaptive solution to re-use any relevant resources available to the system before the selection situation appeared. The second constraint, the satisficing constraint, describes the fact that a trait only needs to behave more advantageously than its competitors in order to be selected. In this paper I describe how bounded-functionality can inform an evolutionary-minded approach to cognitive neuroscience. In order to do so, I resort to Nikolaas Tinbergen’s four questions about how to understand behavior, namely: function, causation, development and evolution. The bottom line of assuming Tinbergen’s questions is that any approach to cognitive neuroscience is intrinsically tentative, slow, and messy.},

"In recent work, Boyer and Petersen (2012) explain the recurrence of social institutional features across different cultures by grounding them in our evolved psyche. According to Boyer and Petersen, 'institutions are best understood against the background of a set of human psychological dispositions that influence the effort needed to adopt and accept certain social arrangements' (4)." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H6TMUQ3R?page=1}{Vlerick 2016:291})
\par
"institutions emerge naturally out of behavioural dispositions. Marriage, for instance, emerges out of mating strategies, much as borders arise out of territorial behaviour and criminal law out of moral intuitions. In a similar vein, Sperber (1996) grounds recurring cultural facts in our innate mental apparatus. In his 'epidemiology of representations', Sperber sets out to formulate a causal explanation of cultural facts. According to Sperber some representations are more susceptible to become stable, shared representations—and therefore cultural—because those representations are favoured by our mental wiring. The psychological properties with which natural selection endowed us function as a filter, retaining certain kinds of representations and discarding others. Cultural universals—ranging from ideas (e.g. in a divinity, about the natural world) to behavioural patterns (childcare, healthcare, warfare, etc.)—are therefore in an important sense the product of our genetically determined cognitive and affective nature. Universal institutions, being a subset of cultural universals, therefore, are the product of our mental wiring, according to Sperber. How sound is this reasoning? While Sperber, Boyer and Petersen are right in relating the features of recurring social institutions to the dispositions of our evolved mental apparatus, pressing an important point against traditional sociological and philosophical accounts of social ontology (e.g. Gudeman 1986; Searle 1995, 2010)—which turn a blind eye to human nature as a constituent in the emergence of institutions—the 'naturalness' of institutions, as Boyer and Petersen frame it, only provides us with a partial explanation of why similar institutions have emerged independently in very different cultures. They ignore the cultural side of the story." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H6TMUQ3R?page=2}{Vlerick 2016:292})
\par
"Bowles and Gintis (2011) (building on Sober and Wilson 1998 among others) point at what they call multi-level selection. Not only do individuals compete with each other, groups also compete. According to Bowles and Gintis, for a number of reasons—such as dependency on large game hunting in early human environments and the extended time it takes to raise children—cooperation between members of a group endowed the group with significant advantages over non-cooperating groups. Cooperating groups therefore thrived at the expense of other groups and altruistic cooperation was able to spread through cultural transmission." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H6TMUQ3R?page=3}{Vlerick 2016:293})
\par
"The naturalness of institutions is a necessary condition but not a sufficient one for the emergence of universal social institutions. Institutions that are deleterious to groups in the long run will be selected out even if they're a close fit with genetically wired behavioural dispositions. Following Richerson and Boyd (2005), where humans are concerned, natural and cultural selective processes are intricately intertwined." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H6TMUQ3R?page=4}{Vlerick 2016:294})
\par
"In a similar vein, Gintis (2009: 132-135) argues, social norms often function as correlating devices or 'choreographers'. Marriage is no exception. Given the prior knowledge that if either party breaches the contract and adopts an opportunistic strategy, he or she can expect that the other party will no longer uphold his or her part of the bargain, a rational player will not deviate from the social norm (in this case the norm enforcing monogamy in a marital relationship). This norm therefore implements a 'correlated equilibrium'. It correlates both strategies in such a way that it yields the best possible payoff for both players." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H6TMUQ3R?page=8}{Vlerick 2016:298})
\par
"Universal social institutions, therefore, are game-changers. They change the payoff matrix of domains of social interaction by incentivising (through punishment and/or reward) the players to adopt a certain strategy. They change the rules of the game and consequently change the outcome of the game. They solve the evolutionary problem of cooperation and that—I argue—is why they emerged and prevailed."

  abstract = {Philosophers and social scientists have recently turned to Lewis sender–receiver games to provide an account of how lexical terms can acquire meaning through an evolutionary process. However, the evolution of meaning is contingent on both the particular sender–receiver game played and the choice of evolutionary dynamic. In this paper I explore some differences between models that presume an infinitely large and randomly mixed population and models in which a finite number of agents communicate with their neighbors in a social network. My results show that communication with neighbors is more conducive to the evolution of meaning than communication with strangers. Additionally, I show that the behavior of the system is highly dependent on the topological structure of the social network. I argue that a specific class of networks—small world graphs—is especially conducive to the evolution of meaning. This is because small world graphs have a short characteristic path length while still maintaining a high degree of correlation between neighbors. Since many actual social networks, such as friendship networks and nervous systems, are conjectured to be small world structures, these results indicate that these networks are quite hospitable to the efficient evolution of meaning.},

Non-convergent dynamics can sustain partial information transfer even in a zero-sum signalling game. In particular, I investigate a signalling game in which messages are free, the state-act payoffs resemble rock–paper–scissors, and senders and receivers adjust their strategies according to the replicator dynamic. This system exhibits Hamiltonian chaos and trajectories do not converge to equilibria. This persistent out-of-equilibrium behaviour results in messages that do not perfectly reveal the sender's private information, but do transfer information as quantified by the Kullback–Leibler divergence. This finding shows that adaptive dynamics can enable information transmission even though messages at equilibria are meaningless. This suggests a new explanation for the evolution or spontaneous emergence of meaning: non-convergent adaptive dynamics. 1{$\quad$}Introduction 2{$\quad$}Lewis Signalling Games and Information Transfer 3{$\quad$}Evolution and Lewis Signalling Games 4{$\quad$}Signalling Games with Opposing Interests 5{$\quad$}Dynamics of Zero-Sum Signalling Games 6{$\quad$}Deterministic Chaos and Information Transfer 7{$\quad$}Conclusion}

In a slogan: other minds are neither seen nor inferred.

Is there evidence in his work that perhaps agents do have more influence than his concept of structuralism can account for? I suggest that this is the case and will argue that Foucault's structuralist views are incomplete and result in an incoherence.

  abstract = {Subjects’ poor performance relative to normative standards on reasoning tasks has been supposed to have ‘bleak implications for rationality’ (Nisbett \& Borgida, 1975). More recent experimental work suggests that considerations of relevance underlie performance in at least some reasoning paradigms (Sperber et al., 1995; Girotto et al., 2001; Van der Henst et al., 2002). It is argued here that this finding has positive implications for human rationality since the relevance theoretic comprehension procedure is computationally efficient and well-adapted to the ostensive communicative environment: it is a good example of bounded and adaptive rationality in Gigerenzer’s terms (Gigerenzer and Todd, 1999), and, uniquely, it is a fast and frugal satisficing heuristic which seeks optimal solutions.},

Relevance theory is based on a definition of relevance and two principles of relevance: a Cognitive Principle (that human cognition is geared to the maximisation of relevance), and a Communicative Principle (that utterances create expectations of optimal relevance). We explain the motivation for these principles and illustrate their application to a variety of pragmatic problems. We end by considering the implications of this relevance-theoretic approach for the architecture of the mind. 1},

Relevance and relevance theory

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
The central\\
claim of relevance theory is that the expectations of relevance raised by an utterance\\
are precise enough, and predictable enough, to guide the hearer towards the speaker’s\\
meaning. The aim is to explain in cognitively realistic terms what these expectations\\
of relevance amount to, and how they might contribute to an empirically plausible\\
account of comprehension. — с. 250

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
any external stimulus or\\
internal representation which provides an input to cognitive processes may be relevant\\
to an individual at some time — с 251

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
According to relevance theory, utterances raise\\
expectations of relevance not because speakers are expected to obey a Co-operative\\
Principle and maxims or some other specifically communicative convention, but\\
because the search for relevance is a basic feature of human cognition, which\\
communicators may exploit. — с 251

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
The most important type of cognitive effect achieved by processing an input in a\\
context is a CONTEXTUAL IMPLICATION , a conclusion deducible from the input and the\\
context together, but from neither input nor context alone. — с 251

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
it is highly unlikely that individuals have to compute numerical values for effort\\
and effect when assessing relevance ‘from the inside’. Such computation would itself\\
be effort-consuming and therefore detract from relevance. — с 253

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
As noted in Relevance (124-32), it therefore seems preferable to treat effort and effect\\
as non-representational dimensions of mental processes: they exist and play a role in\\
cognition whether or not they are mentally represented; and when they are mentally\\
represented, it is in the form of intuitive comparative judgements rather than absolute\\
numerical ones. The same is true of relevance, which is a function of effort and\\
effect. — \textbf{Effort and effect do not need to be representational dimensions of mental processes, agents do not need to compute relevance if we say that relevance optimization is a consequence of an organisms fitness-optimizing strategy. }

\end{quotation}

For arguments against the view that co-operation in Grice’s sense is fundamental to\\
communication, see Wilson \& Sperber (1981), Sperber \& Wilson (1986a): 161-2, Smith \& Wilson\\
(1992), Sperber (1994). For more general arguments that rationality in communication does not\\
require co-operation in Grice’s sense, see Kasher (1976), Sperber (2000), Sperber \& Wilson (2002).

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Optimal relevance\\
An ostensive stimulus is optimally relevant to an audience iff:\\
a. It is relevant enough to be worth the audience’s processing effort;\\
b. It is the most relevant one compatible with communicator’s abilities and\\
preferences. — c 257

On the use of silence as an ostensive stimulus, see Morgan \& Green (1987): 727, Sperber \&\\
Wilson (1987b): 746-7.

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
On a Gricean account, violation\\
of the first Quantity maxim (‘Make your contribution as informative as required’) is\\
invariably attributed to the communicator’s INABILITY – rather than\\
UNWILLINGNESS – to provide the required information. Unwillingness to make\\
one’s contribution ‘such as is required’ is a violation of the Co -operative Principle,\\
and suspension of the Co -operative Principle should make it impossible to convey any\\
conversational implicatures at all. — c 258

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Relevance-theoretic comprehension procedure\\
a. Follow a path of least effort in computing cognitive effects: Test\\
interpretive hypotheses (disambiguations, reference resolutions, implicatures, etc.) in order of accessibility.\\
b. Stop when your expectations of relevance are satisfied. — c 260

\begin{quotation}
On the distinction between primary and secondary pragmatic processes, see Breheny (2002),\\
Recanati (2002a), Carston (this volume, forthcoming), Sperber \& Wilson (2002). Some of the\\
literature on generalised conversational implicature and discourse pragmatics tacitly invokes a similar\\
distinction (cf. Hobbs 1985, Lascarides \& Asher 1993, Lascarides, Copestake \& Briscoe 1996,\\
Levinson 2000). See also footnotes 23 and 24. — с 262

Sub-tasks in the overall comprehension process\\
a. Constructing an appropriate hypothesis about explicit content (in relevance-\\

assumptions (in relevance-theoretic terms, IMPLICATED PREMISES ).\\

The link between mind-reading and communication is confirmed by a\\
wealth of developmental and neuropsychological evidence — See, for example, Perner, Frith, Leslie \& Leekam (1989), Happé (1993), Baron -Cohen (1995),\\
Mitchell, Robinson \& Thompson (1999), Happé \& Loth (2002), Papafragou (2002), and the papers in\\
Mind \& Language 17.1-2 (2002).

\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Grice’s analysis of overt communication as involving the expression and recognition\\
of intentions treats comprehension as a variety of MIND - READING , or THEORY OF MIND\\
(the ability to attribute mental states to others in order to explain and predict their\\
behaviour) — See, for example, Whiten (1991), Davies and Stone (1995a,b), Carruthers \& Smith (1996), Malle,\\
Moses \& Baldwin (2001).

  abstract = {In Making Things Happen, James Woodward develops a new and ambitious comprehensive theory of causation and explanation that draws on literature from a variety of disciplines and which applies to a wide variety of claims in science and everyday life. His theory is a manipulationist account, proposing that causal and explanatory relationships are relationships that are potentially exploitable for purposes of manipulation and control. This account has its roots in the commonsense idea that causes are means for bringing about effects; but it also draws on a long tradition of work inexperimental design, econometrics, and statistics. Woodward shows how these ideas may be generalized to other areas of science from the social scientific and biomedical contexts for which they were originally designed. He also provides philosophical foundations for the manipulationist approach, drawing out its implications, comparing it withalternative approaches, and defending it from common criticisms. In doing so, he shows how the manipulationist account both illuminates important features of successful causal explanation in the natural and social sciences, and avoids the counterexamples and difficulties that infect alternativeapproaches, from the deductive-nomological model onwards. Making Things Happen will interest philosophers working in the philosophy of science, the philosophy of social science, and metaphysics, and as well as anyone interested in causation, explanation, and scientific methodology.},

In this paper, we dissect this metaphor by distinguishing between different dimensions of the goodness of an explanation: nonsensitivity, cognitive salience, precision, factual accuracy and degree of integration. These dimensions are partially independent and often come into conflict. Our main contribution is to go beyond simple stipulation or description by explicating why these factors are taken to be explanatory virtues. We accomplish this by using the contrastive-counterfactual approach to explanation and the view of understanding as an inferential ability. By combining these perspectives, we show how the explanatory power of an explanation in a given dimension can be assessed by showing the range of answers it provides to what-if-things-had-been-different questions and the theoretical and pragmatic importance of these questions. Our account also explains intuitions linking explanation to unification or to exhibition of a mechanism.},

  abstract = {Real networks are not only multi-layered yet also dynamic. The role of coordinated network evolution regarding dynamic multi-layer networks where both network and strategy evolution simultaneously show diverse interdependence by layers remains poorly addressed. Here, we propose a general and simple coevolution framework to analyze how coordination of different dynamical processes affects strategy propagation in synergistically evolving interdependent networks. The strategic feedback constitutes the main driving force of network evolution yet the inherent cross-layer self-optimization functions as its compensation. We show that these two ingredients often catalyze a better performance of network evolution in propagating cooperation. Coordinated network evolution may be a double-edged sword to cooperation and the network-adapting rate plays a crucial role in flipping its double-sided effect. It often economizes the cost and time consumption for driving the system to the full cooperation phase. Importantly, strongly coupled slow-tuned networks can outperform weakly coupled fast-regulated networks in solving social dilemmas, highlighting the fundamental advantages of coordinated network evolution and the importance of synergistic effect of dynamical processes in upholding human cooperation in multiplex networks. Decoding the origin of cooperation as well as its persistence in humans and other species is the core mission of evolutionary game theory [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib1"{$>$}1{$<$}/a{$>$}]. The heart of this enduring puzzle lies in two aspects. First, altruistic cooperation often benefits others yet incurs a cost to its carriers. In sharp contrast, however, selfish defection most of the time free rides on others' contributions at almost no cost to its carriers. From an evolutionary point of view, as a consequence, cooperation becomes the one that should have been wiped out [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib2"{$>$}2{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib3"{$>$}3{$<$}/a{$>$}]. This theoretical prediction gives prominence to an increasing inconsistency with ubiquitous cooperation that has laid a solid foundation for the success of human societies. Aside from this point, if both cooperate it commonly maximizes the collective good in this context, thus also establishing a dilemma regarding what is best for an individual and what is best for the group [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib4"{$>$}4{$<$}/a{$>$}]. Myriad mechanisms such as kin selection [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib5"{$>$}5{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib6"{$>$}6{$<$}/a{$>$}], punishment [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib7"{$>$}7{$<$}/a{$>$}–{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib10"{$>$}10{$<$}/a{$>$}] and voluntary participation [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib11"{$>$}11{$<$}/a{$>$}] are proposed to rescue such cooperation tragedy in this spectrum (see review [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib12"{$>$}12{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib13"{$>$}13{$<$}/a{$>$}]). In particular, by taking into account the following aspects, the recent shift from evolutionary games in well-mixed populations [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib14"{$>$}14{$<$}/a{$>$}–{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib16"{$>$}16{$<$}/a{$>$}] and static networks [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib17"{$>$}17{$<$}/a{$>$}–{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib23"{$>$}23{$<$}/a{$>$}] to evolutionary games in multiplex networks [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib24"{$>$}24{$<$}/a{$>$}–{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib27"{$>$}27{$<$}/a{$>$}] and dynamic networks [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib28"{$>$}28{$<$}/a{$>$}–{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib34"{$>$}34{$<$}/a{$>$}] has stimulated mounting efforts in exploring cooperation dynamics in more realistic scenarios (see review [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib35"{$>$}35{$<$}/a{$>$}–{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib38"{$>$}38{$<$}/a{$>$}]). First, the vast majority of literatures to date have suggested that in many circumstances single-layer networks are no longer suitable for capturing the nature of backbones of physical, biological, and social systems due to their inability to encode the universal multiplexity of real systems [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib39"{$>$}39{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib40"{$>$}40{$<$}/a{$>$}]. More importantly, system dynamics in multiplexes in general differs dramatically from that in simplexes by virtue of diverse problem-oriented multi-domain interdependence. For instance, in the study of interdependent networks, Buldyrev {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib41"{$>$}41{$<$}/a{$>$}] reported that failure of nodes in one layer is likely to beget failure of dependent nodes in other layers, thus causing a cascade of failure. The analysis around topology interdependence has become a primary means of mitigating cascading failures. In [{$<$}a class="cite hastip" href="\#njpab32c7bib42"{$>$}42{$<$}/a{$>$}], Parshani {$<$}em{$>$}et al{$<$}/em{$>$} also showed analytically that two different types of links are ne {$<$}p{$>$}-Abstract Truncated-{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {This paper aims to assess current theoretical findings on the origin of coordination by salience and suggests a way to clarify the existing framework. The main concern is to reveal how different coordination mechanisms rely on specific epistemic aspects of reasoning. The paper highlights the fact that basic epistemic assumptions of theories diverge in a way that makes them essentially distinctive. Consequently, recommendations and predictions of the traditional views of coordination by salience are, in principle, based on the processes related to the agent’s presumptions regarding the cognitive abilities of a co-player. This finding implies that we should consider these theories as complementary, and not competitive, explanations of the same phenomenon.},

These accounts have complementary explanatory vices and virtues. They also share a natural assumption: that interpretation in terms of mental states is “spectatorial”, aiming exclusively for an objective description of the mental facts about self and others. I argue that if one rejects this assumption in favor of the view that interpretation in terms of mental states also plays important regulative roles with respect to minds and behavior, a new and superior conception of the relationship between metacognition and social cognition comes into view. On this conception, person-level metacognitive concepts are socio-cognitive tools that shape us into better cognitive agents and more predictable cognitive objects, thereby enhancing our abilities at social coordination. Mastery of these metacognitive concepts relies on subpersonal, non-conceptual, procedural metacognition. This reconceptualization of the relationship between metacognition and social cognition combines the complementary explanatory virtues of the two traditional conceptions, while avoiding their complementary explanatory vices. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

  abstract = {Interactions among individuals in natural populations often occur in a dynamically changing environment. Understanding the role of environmental variation in population dynamics has long been a central topic in theoretical ecology and population biology. However, the key question of how individuals, in the middle of challenging social dilemmas (e.g. the 'tragedy of the commons'), modulate their behaviours to adapt to the fluctuation of the environment has not yet been addressed satisfactorily. Using evolutionary game theory, we develop a framework of stochastic games that incorporates the adaptive mechanism of reinforcement learning to investigate whether cooperative behaviours can evolve in the ever-changing group interaction environment. When the action choices of players are just slightly influenced by past reinforcements, we construct an analytical condition to determine whether cooperation can be favoured over defection. Intuitively, this condition reveals why and how the environment can mediate cooperative dilemmas. Under our model architecture, we also compare this learning mechanism with two non-learning decision rules, and we find that learning significantly improves the propensity for cooperation in weak social dilemmas, and, in sharp contrast, hinders cooperation in strong social dilemmas. Our results suggest that in complex social–ecological dilemmas, learning enables the adaptation of individuals to varying environments.},

  abstract = {Social ontological inquiry has been pursued in analytic philosophy as well as in the social scientific tradition of critical realism. These traditions have remained largely separate despite partly overlapping concerns and similar underlying strategies of argumentation. They have also both been the subject of similar criticisms based on naturalistic approaches to the philosophy of science, which have addressed their apparent reliance on a transcendental mode of reasoning, their seeming distance from social scientific practice, and their (erroneous?) tendency to advocate global solutions to local and pragmatic problems. Two approaches aiming to naturalize these two traditions of social ontology have been proposed in recent years: one drawing on a Gierean, model-based approach to scientific practice, the other drawing on inference to the best explanation. In our paper, we compare and contrast these naturalistic approaches to social ontology in terms of their capacity to respond to the aforementioned challenges. We also defend a form of methodological pluralism, according to which there are multiple different naturalistically acceptable approaches to social ontology, which emphasize contrasting procedural continuities between social scientific research and philosophical practice.},

  abstract = {There's a general assumption that teleology and function do not exist in inanimate nature. Throughout biology, it is generally taken as granted that teleology (or teleonomy) and functions are not only unique to life, but perhaps even a defining quality of life. For many, it's obvious that rocks, water, and the like, are not teleological, nor could they possibly have stand-alone functions. This idea - that teleology and function are unique to life - is the target of this paper. I begin with an overview of McShea's   field theoretic   account of teleology. I start with the field theoretic account because it presents a promising analysis of teleological systems. It is promising because, in not making any assumptions about life's special status in teleological systems, it avoids counterexamples that have problematized other accounts. I then consider some of the prominent efforts that some have made to avoid ascribing functions or teleology to some form of inanimate nature. In my assessment, none of the efforts are successful. I conclude by offering mineral evolution as a case study to show how inanimate nature can be both teleological and functional. The evolution of mineral species reveals that teleology and function extend to inanimate nature, and that teleology and function come in degrees.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}What is qualitative research? If we look for a precise definition of qualitative research, and specifically for one that addresses its distinctive feature of being "qualitative," the literature is meager. In this article we systematically search, identify and analyze a sample of 89 sources using or attempting to define the term "qualitative." Then, drawing on ideas we find scattered across existing work, and based on Becker's classic study of marijuana consumption, we formulate and illustrate a definition that tries to capture its core elements. We define qualitative research as an iterative process in which improved understanding to the scientific community is achieved by making new significant distinctions resulting from getting closer to the phenomenon studied. This formulation is developed as a tool to help improve research designs while stressing that a qualitative dimension is present in quantitative work as well. Additionally, it can facilitate teaching, communication between researchers, diminish the gap between qualitative and quantitative researchers, help to address critiques of qualitative methods, and be used as a standard of evaluation of qualitative research.{$<$}/p{$>$}}

  abstract = {This paper offers a contribution to debates around integrative aspects of systems biology and engages with issues related to the circumstances under which physicists look at biological problems. We use oral history as one of the methodological tools to gather the empirical material, conducting interviews with physicists working in systems biology. The interviews were conducted at several institutions in Brazil, Germany, Israel and the U.S. Biological research has been increasingly dependent on computational methods, high-throughput technologies, and multidisciplinary skills. Quantitative scientists are joining biological departments and collaborations between physicists and biologists are particularly vigorous. This state of affairs raises a number of questions, such as: What are the circumstances under which physicists approach biological problems in systems biology? What kind of interdisciplinary challenges must be tackled? The paper suggests that, concerning physicists' move to work on biological systems, there are common reasons to move, the transition must be understood in terms of degrees, physicists have a rationale for simplifying systems, and distinct conceptions of model and modeling strategies are recurrent. We identified problems regarding linguistic clarity and integration of epistemological aims. We conclude that cultural unconformities within the systems biology community have important consequences to the flow of scientific knowledge.}

  abstract = {In this paper we attempt to analyze the concept of quantum probability within quantum computation and quantum computational logic. While the subjectivist interpretation of quantum probability explains it as a reliable predictive tool for an agent in order to compute measurement outcomes, the objectivist interpretation understands quantum probability as providing reliable information of a real state of affairs. After discussing these different viewpoints we propose a particular objectivist interpretation grounded on the idea that the Born rule provides information about an intensive realm of reality. We then turn our attention to the way in which the subjectivist interpretation of probability is presently applied within both quantum computation and quantum computational logic. Taking as a standpoint our proposed intensive account of quantum probability we discuss the possibilities and advantages it might open for the modeling and development of both quantum computation and quantum computational logic.}

  abstract = {This volume concerns the longstanding intellectual puzzle of how individuals overcome their biological, neural, and mental finitude to achieve sociality. It explores how humans take each other into account, coordinate their actions, and are able to share their inner states and to communicate. Sophisticated views on the bases of sociality are detailed at the level of neural mechanisms, perception and memory, motivation, communication and dialog, culture, and evolution. These insights have been inspired by major strides and exciting new developments in disciplines as far afield as ethology, evolutionary ecology, neuroscience, cognition, memory, developmental and social psychology, psycholinguistics, philosophy, robotics, and sociology. The volume is the first to bridge these disciplinary boundaries to lay the foundations for an integrated and general conceptualization of the bases of sociality and its implications for psychology. Each contribution presents different levels of the grounding of sociality and will further stimulate novel approaches to linking different layers of sociality, from the neural to the cultural level.},

  abstract = {Recent work in the cognitive sciences has argued that beliefs sometimes acquire signaling functions in virtue of their ability to reveal information that manipulates "mindreaders." This paper sketches some of the evolutionary and design considerations that could take agents from solipsistic goal pursuit to beliefs that serve as social signals. Such beliefs will be governed by norms besides just the traditional norms of epistemology (e.g., truth and rational support). As agents become better at detecting the agency of others, either through evolutionary history or individual learning, the candidate pool for signaling expands. This logic holds for natural and artificial agents that find themselves in recurring social situations that reward the sharing of one's thoughts.},

  abstract = {In recent years, biologists and philosophers of science have argued that evolutionary theory should incorporate more seriously the idea of 'reciprocal causation.' This notion refers to feedback loops whereby organisms change their experiences of the environment or alter the physical properties of their surroundings. In these loops, in particular niche constructing activities are central, since they may alter selection pressures acting on organisms, and thus affect their evolutionary trajectories. This paper discusses long-standing problems that emerge when studying such reciprocal causal processes between organisms and environments. By comparing past approaches to reciprocal causation from the early twentieth century with contemporary ones in niche construction theory, we identify two central reoccurring problems: All of these approaches have not been able to provide a conceptual framework that allows (i) maintaining meaningful boundaries between organisms and environments, instead of merging the two, and (ii) integrating experiential and physical kinds of reciprocal causation. By building on case studies of niche construction research, we provide a model that is able to solve these two problems. It allows distinguishing between mutually interacting organisms and environments in complex scenarios, as well as integrating various forms of experiential and physical niche construction.},

The main purpose of this work is to analyze, at an anthropological, phenomenological and epistemological level, how the fundamental characteristics of the recognition of otherness and intercorporeity among human beings contribute to changing the image of nature in the light of a possible new relationship between living bodies, neurophysiological systems and empathy. From this point of view, the hypothesis to investigate is that neurophenomenology, understood as a new evolutionary, multidimensional and autopoietic approach, is capable of probing the preconditions of the possible delineation of a phenomenology of intersubjectivity shaped by the neuroscientific turning point, represented by the discovery of mirror neurons. At this level, the neuroscientific data are interpreted according to a specific interdisciplinary perspective, thus trying to offer a possible unitary and integrated theoretical framework.},

  abstract = {In everyday situations, and particularly in some sport and working contexts, humans face an inherently unpredictable and uncertain environment. All sorts of unpredictable and unexpected things happen but typically people are able to skillfully adapt. In this paper, we address two key questions in cognitive science. First, how is an agent able to bring its previously learned skill to bear on a novel situation? Second, how can an agent be both sensitive to the particularity of a given situation, while remaining flexibly poised for many other possibilities for action? We will argue that both the sensitivity to novel situations and the sensitivity to a multiplicity of action possibilities are enabled by the property of skilled agency that we will call   metastable attunement  . We characterize a skilled agent's flexible interactions with a dynamically changing environment in terms of metastable dynamics in agent-environment systems. What we find in metastability is the realization of two competing tendencies: the tendency of the agent to express their intrinsic dynamics and the tendency to search for new possibilities. Metastably attuned agents are ready to engage with a multiplicity of affordances, allowing for a balance between stability and flexibility. On the one hand, agents are able to exploit affordances they are attuned to, while at the same time being ready to flexibly explore for other affordances. Metastable attunement allows agents to smoothly transition between these possible configurations so as to adapt their behaviour to what the particular situation requires. We go on to describe the role metastability plays in learning of new skills, and in skilful behaviour more generally. Finally, drawing upon work in art, architecture and sports science, we develop a number of perspectives on how to investigate metastable attunement in real life situations.},

In this article, our aim is to challenge this view by showing how the Price equation can work as the core of a general theoretical framework for evolutionary phenomena. To support this claim, we outline some unnoticed structural similarities between physical theories (in particular, classical mechanics) and evolutionary biology. More specifically, we shall argue that the Price equation, in the same way as fundamental formalisms in physics, can serve as a heuristic principle to formulate and systematise different theories and models in evolutionary biology.},

  abstract = {Non-causal accounts of action explanation have long been criticized for lacking a positive thesis, relying primarily on negative arguments to undercut the standard Causal Theory of Action (Wilson and Shpall , in: Zalta (ed) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2016). Additionally, it is commonly thought that non-causal accounts fail to provide an answer to Donald Davidson's (1963) challenge for theories of reasons explanations of actions. According to Davidson's challenge, a plausible non-causal account of reasons explanations must provide a way of connecting an agent's reasons, not only to what she ought to do, but to what she actually does. That is, such explanations must be truth-apt, not mere rationalizations. My aim in this paper is to show how a non-causal account of action can provide explanations that are truth-apt and genuinely explanatory. To make this argument, I take as a given an account of the practical syllogism (the syllogistic form of practical reasoning) discussed by Michael Thompson (Life and action: elementary structures of practice and practical thought, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2008) and Eric Wiland (Reasons, Continuum, New York, 2012), according to which the practical syllogism is   truly practical   rather than propositional in nature. Next, I present my primary positive thesis: reasons for actions have explanatory power in virtue of being parts of a   structure  —the practical syllogism—that contains the action being explained. I then argue that structural action explanations can meet Davidson's challenge and that they genuinely explain actions. Finally, I conclude by addressing some objections to my argument.},

  abstract = {Unless one embraces activities as foundational, understanding activities in mechanisms requires an account of the means by which entities in biological mechanisms engage in their activities—an account that does not merely explain activities in terms of more basic entities and activities. Recent biological research on molecular motors (myosin and kinesin) exemplifies such an account, one that explains activities in terms of free energy and constraints. After describing the characteristic "stepping" activities of these molecules and mapping the stages of those steps onto the stages of the motors' hydrolytic cycles, researchers pieced together from images of the molecules in different hydrolyzation states accounts of how the chemical energy in ATP is transformed in the constrained environments of the motors into the characteristic activities of the motors. We argue that New Mechanism's standard set of analytic categories—entities (parts), activities (operations), and organization—should be expanded to include constraints and energetics. Not only is such an expansion required descriptively to capture research on molecular motors but, more importantly from a philosophical point of view, it enables a non-regressive account of activities in mechanisms. In other words, this expansion enables a philosophical account of mechanistic explanation that avoids a regress of entities and activities "all the way down." Rather, mechanistic explanation bottoms out in constraints and energetics.},
